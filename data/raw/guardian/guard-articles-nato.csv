Boris Johnson’s perennial boosterism is never truthful and I hope this particular mad idea never sees the light of day. Yes, bring Ukraine into Nato and answer Putin’s accusation head-on, or stay entirely out of the argument and protect those states who are already in Nato against the certain interference that will follow. The much criticised offer of helmets by the German government is of the same substance as Johnson’s rhetoric. A proxy war would destroy Ukrainians’ westward, anti-Putin-kleptocracy ambitions. Anthony O’Neill Glasgow  Congratulations to Simon Tisdall for his straight-talking article, largely backing up the wise piece by Simon Jenkins last month (Britain should stay well out of Russia’s border dispute with Ukraine, 20 January). The way out of this crisis isn’t by Johnsonian grandstanding, but by patient diplomacy, as Emmanuel Macron evidently realises, and from the starting point of the Minsk II accords – agreed at the time by Ukraine, but in seven years never implemented. It will happen neither by surrendering to, nor utterly rejecting, the Kremlin’s maximalist demands, but step by step, starting with the running sore of Donbas. It’s clear from Vasyl Filipchuk’s and others’ comments (Ukraine’s leader stood on platform of peace, but finds himself on brink of war, 20 February) that far-sighted Ukrainians realise this too. Robin Milner-Gulland Washington, West Sussex In characterising a hypothetical Ukrainian war of resistance against Russian occupation as a “proxy war” on the part of Britain and other western countries, Simon Tisdall is falling into the colonialist mindset of denying Ukrainians’ own agency and imagining that they would not fight such a war without western support. This is delusional. The idea that postcolonial Ukraine would not fight a war of resistance against an occupation by their former imperial rulers is as ridiculous as the idea that Ireland, Kenya or Vietnam – among many others – would not fight an occupation by theirs. If Russia occupies, there will be a war of resistance until Russia leaves, irrespective of the opinions and actions of foreign governments. Britain can choose to stand up against Russia by arming Ukraine, supporting its entry into Nato and increasing sanctions against Russia, or it can choose to stay neutral in the face of oppression. Either way, Ukrainians will keep fighting for their independence as colonised people always have done and always will do. There can be no peace without justice, in Ukraine or anywhere else. Adam Lawson Hackney, London Short of full-scale invasion at this point, Vladimir Putin may be content to take back Ukraine one bite at a time. He is likely to pause now and see whether the full weight of western sanctions is applied. He can reasonably expect that differences between the US and EU countries will hamper this. If this is the case, he may be willing to delay. A lot can happen in the next few years to his advantage, not least the coming upheaval in the US elections, which could bring a new administration more inclined to let western Europe defend itself. As we are all aware, Putin has wider ambitions than Ukraine and we are entering into an uncertain, if not perilous decade for democracy.David Copsey Brighton Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

That is clear. What is also clear is why he did it. An increasing number of politicians and media analysts claim Putin may be mentally unstable, or that he is isolated in a bubble of yes-men who don’t warn him of dangers ahead. Many commentators say he is trying to restore the Soviet Union or recreate a Russian sphere of influence on his country’s borders, and that this week’s intrusion into eastern Ukraine is the first step towards an all-out attack on Kyiv to topple its government and even move against the Baltic states. None of these assertions is necessarily true.  The Russian president is a rational man with his own analysis of recent European history. Coming from a former Communist, his blaming of Lenin for giving excessive scope to local nationalism in drawing up the Soviet constitution is remarkable. Similarly, his criticism of the way national elites destroyed the Soviet Union in its final years is sharp. Does he want to turn the clock back? People often quote his statement “the demise of the Soviet Union was the greatest geopolitical catastrophe of the century”. But it bears pointing out that he enlarged on it later, saying: “Anyone who doesn’t regret the passing of the Soviet Union has no heart. Anyone who wants it restored has no brains.” It is crucially important for those who might seek to end or ameliorate this crisis to first understand his mindset. What happened this week is that Putin lost his patience, and his temper. He is furious with the Ukraine government. He feels it repeatedly rejected the Minsk agreement, which would give the Ukrainian provinces of Donetsk and Luhansk substantial autonomy. He is angry with France and Germany, the co-signatories, and the United States, for not pressing Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, to implement them. He is equally angry with the Americans for not taking on board Russia’s security concerns about Nato’s expansion and the deployment of offensive missiles close to Russia’s borders. To those who say Nato is entitled to invite any state to join, Putin argues that the “open door” policy is conditioned by a second principle, which Nato states have accepted: namely that the enhancement of a state’s security should not be to the detriment of the security of other states (such as Russia). As recently as 2010 Barack Obama put his signature to the principle at a summit of the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE). The summit’s declaration includes a wonderfully idealistic ambition: “We recommit ourselves to the vision of a free, democratic, common and indivisible Euro-Atlantic and Eurasian security community stretching from Vancouver to Vladivostok”. This echoes Mikhail Gorbachev’s plea, when the cold war division of Europe ended, for Russia and other European states to live together in a “common European home”. We now suffer in the shadow of the thwarting of that dream. Russia’s belief in Nato ‘betrayal’ – and why it matters todayRead more For Putin, Obama’s signing of the OSCE statement is proof of the hypocrisy that goes back to earlier US presidents, who showed the dishonesty of Nato’s “open door” policy by rejecting Russia’s repeated feelers about joining the alliance. In his speech this week, the Russian leader said he had asked Bill Clinton about the possibility of membership but was fobbed off with the argument that Russia was too big. In 2000, during his first weeks as president, Putin was asked by David Frost on the BBC if it was possible Russia could join Nato. He replied: “I would not rule such a possibility out, if and when Russia’s views are taken into account as those of an equal partner.” George Robertson, a former Nato secretary general, recently recalled meeting Putin during his time at Nato: “Putin said, ‘When are you going to invite us to join Nato?’ And [Robertson] said: ‘Well, we don’t invite people to join Nato, they apply to join Nato.’” From outside the alliance, Putin has seen it expand continually. He says he does not seek a revived Soviet Union but a buffer zone that would be, as he put it in a long essay last year, “not anti-Russia”. John Kennedy wanted a similar cordon sanitaire when Khrushchev tried to put nuclear missiles in Cuba in 1962. Putin suggested on Tuesday that Ukraine should return to the strategy of neutrality that was in the Ukrainian constitution until the “coup” that toppled the Yanukovych government in 2014, and brought pro-US nationalists to power. After all, a majority of Ukrainian MPs then believed that the country’s fragile unity would be more secure if it was not pulled and pushed by rival pressures from Moscow and the west. Nato’s stance over membership for Ukraine was what sparked Russia’s takeover of Crimea in 2014. Putin feared the port of Sevastopol, home of Russia’s Black Sea fleet, would soon belong to the Americans. The western narrative sees Crimea as the first use of force to change territorial borders in Europe since the second world war. Putin sees this as selective amnesia, forgetting that Nato bombed Serbia in 1999 to detach Kosovo and make it an independent state. Convinced that Nato will never reject Ukraine’s membership, Putin has now taken his own steps to block it. By invading Donetsk and Luhansk, he has created a “frozen conflict”, knowing the alliance cannot admit countries that don’t control all their borders. Frozen conflicts already cripple Georgia and Moldova, which are also split by pro-Russian statelets. Now Ukraine joins the list. There is speculation about what will happen next but from his standpoint, it is not actually necessary to send troops further into the country. He has already taken what he needs.

Here’s how the day unfolded in Washington, as the world offered its prayers to Ukraine in the face of a full-scale Russian invasion:
Biden denounced Vladimir Putin’s decision to move forward with the invasion. In a speech at the White House this afternoon, Biden told the nation:“Putin is the aggressor. Putin chose this war. And now he and his country will bear the consequences.”
Biden announced a new round of sanctions targeting Russian financial institutions and elite families. The sanctions call for Sberbank, Russia’s largest bank, to be severed from the US financial system, restricting the bank’s access to transactions made in the American dollar. Full sanctions will also be imposed on four other financial institutions, including Russia’s second-largest bank of VTB, freezing all of their US-based assets.
But Biden did not call for Russia to be banned from the Swift banking system, and he is not issuing direct sanctions on Putin, as some lawmakers have called for. Biden said some European leaders do not support cutting off Russia’s access to Swift, and he claimed direct sanctions on Putin were still possible, although he did not explain why he is not taking that step now.
The US is deploying additional troops to Germany, although Biden made clear that he would not send service members to Ukraine. “Our forces are not, and will not be, engaged in the conflict with Russia in Ukraine,” Biden said. “Our forces are not going to Europe to fight in Ukraine, but to defend our Nato allies and reassure those allies in the east.”
During her evening press briefing, Jen Psaki said the US was prepared to take Ukrainian refugees, though she expected the vast majority would prefer to remain in Europe. Asked about Putin’s references to Russia’s nuclear arsenal, Psaki said: “We don’t see any increased threat in that regard at the present time.”

Assuming Ukraine doesn’t have a month, is the US effectively conceding Ukraine to Russia, a reporter asked?Psaki roundly rejected that notion. “There’s nothing about the president’s strategy or approach or leadership in the world ... that suggests that he is ceding anything,” she said. At the end of the briefing, after she signaled it was over by putting on her mask, a reporter asked if the US believed Russia was preparing to invade other countries beyond Ukraine. “We certainly think he has grander ambitions,” Psaki said of Putin. Updated at 23.37 GMT 24 Feb 202223.23Asked in real time to respond to comments from Republican Senator Ted Cruz, who reportedly called Psaki “peppermint patty” during a speech at CPAC, the White House press secretary laughed and said she did not view that as an insult.“Senator Cruz, I like peppermint patty,” she said. “I’m a little tougher than that.” 24 Feb 202223.12Psaki said Biden is still planning to announce his nominee for the supreme court before the end of the month. It’s the 24th, the month ends on the 28th. “We are still on track to make an announcement before the end of the month,” she said. She added that “no job offer has been made”.In the midst of coordinating a response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, and interviewing potential supreme court nominees, Psaki said Biden is also preparing to give his State of the Union address on 1 March. She said he is working with his Covid team to offer an update to the American people on the state of the pandemic. Psaki also said the US was “outraged” by reports that Russian troops have taken some staff hostage at the Chernobyl nuclear site. She called for their immediate release.Pressed on when sanctions may start to take effect, Psaki said they already are. “Look at where the ruble’s at,” she said. Updated at 23.40 GMT 24 Feb 202223.00Psaki is speaking now, and began by outlining Biden’s movements over the last several hours since Russia launched its pre-dawn invasion of Ukraine. She said he “closely monitored” the events on the ground from the Oval Office and later from the residence into the “wee hours” of the morning. Last night, he spoke repeatedly with his national security advisor, Jake Sullivan and also to UN ambassador, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, before she delivered a rousing call-to-arms at the UN security council emergency meeting on Ukraine. He also spoke to Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy, his only phone call with the leader since the Russian invasion. After a round of meetings with Nato leaders and his security council, Biden also spent time briefing Democratic and Republican leaders in Congress by phone. Jen Psaki at the briefing on Thursday. Photograph: Alex Brandon/APPsaki wouldn’t comment on a question about Zelenskiy’s whereabouts but said administration officials continues to be in touch with him. She said the US is working with European countries to prepare for an influx of Ukrainian refugees, but said the US is also prepared to welcome them here. Asked whether the US interpreted Putin’s verbal warning to adversaries as a threat of nuclear war, Psaki said she wasn’t sure what he intended to convey, but added, “we don’t see any increased threat in that regard at this time”.Updated at 23.39 GMT 24 Feb 202222.53“Today was a demonstration that we mean what we say,” Singh said when asked why the US didn’t take even more severe actions such as removing Russia from the Swift international banking system. With the measures, he said the US wanted to be careful not to target the average Russian citizen and mitigate the economic consequences for Americans. He stressed that energy is the “one area” where Russia has a strategic advantage, and that it wouldn’t be wise to do disrupt the flow of energy. Singh is acknowledging that the measures will take time to take hold. Asked about a comment Biden made earlier, that “no one” expected sanctions to deter an invasion, Singh defended the administration’s course of action and said imposing steeper penalties could have pre-empted diplomatic efforts or signaled to Putin that he had little left to lose. “The goal of our sanctions is to make this a strategic failure for Russia,” he said. “So when we say all options are on the table ... it would be a mistake to doubt that resolve,” he said.Updated at 23.36 GMT 24 Feb 202222.40Psaki has arrived, joined by Daleep Singh, the deputy national security advisor for international economics and the deputy national economic council director. “This is a briefing I never wanted to give,” Singh said. “Putin has made his choice,” he said. “He rejected diplomacy and chose war.”Singh said the US had followed through on its threat to impose the “most severe” sanctions ever levied against Russia. He is outlining in details the economic penalties and export restrictions now being placed on Russia’s largest banks, companies and oligarchs. “Working in tandem, these financial sanctions and export controls will undercut Putin’s aspirations,” he said. He said the impacts would be felt across Russia over time, resulting in “higher inflation, higher interest rates, lower purchasing power ... lower living standards”. He added that the intentionally exempted Russia’s energy sector to avoid disruptions to the current flow of energy from Russia to the world. Updated at 23.34 GMT 24 Feb 202222.26Hello. I’m Lauren Gambino in Washington, specifically, in the back row of the James Brady press room at the White House, where we’re expecting Jen Psaki to take questions shortly. While we wait, the Department of Defense confirmed earlier today that the US is sending 7,000 troops to Germany to “reassure Nato allies”. “We expect them to depart in the coming days,” according to a senior defense official, as reported by Task and Purpose. 7,000 more US troops heading to Germany, senior defense official says.

We should move ahead forcefully against Putin, a war criminal, and demand our allies join us,” Graham said.“When it comes to sanctions against Putin: If we are not doing everything possible, we are not doing enough. Time is not on our side.”Biden said today that his administration is not eliminating the possibility of issuing direct sanctions against Putin, but he ignored questions about why he was not taking that step now.Graham also reiterated that he would work with his congressional colleagues in both parties to quickly pass a bill providing emergency supplemental aid to Ukraine in response to the invasion.“How we deal with Putin determines what happens in other regions like Asia and the Middle East,” Graham said. “We need to get this done in the Senate next week.” 24 Feb 202221.18Obama condemns Russia's 'brutal onslaught' against UkraineBarack Obama has released a new statement condemning the Russian invasion of Ukraine, arguing that Vladimir Putin’s military actions represent a threat to democracies around the world.“Last night, Russia launched a brazen attack on the people of Ukraine, in violation of international law and basic principles of human decency,” the former president said.“For exercising rights that should be available to all people and nations, Ukrainians now face a brutal onslaught that is killing innocents and displacing untold numbers of men, women and children.”Last night, Russia launched a brazen attack on the people of Ukraine, in violation of international law and basic principles of human decency. Here’s my statement on what it means, and what should happen next. pic.twitter.com/Wa0C8XGwvK— Barack Obama (@BarackObama) February 24, 2022
Obama warned that the invasion of Ukraine “threatens the foundation of the international order and security,” underscoring how the “forces of division and authoritarianism” are mounting an assault on global democratic values.“Russia’s invasion of Ukraine shows where these dangerous trends can lead -- and why they cannot be left unchallenged,” Obama said. “People of conscience around the world need to loudly and clearly condemn Russia’s actions and offer support for the Ukrainian people.”Obama called on “every American, regardless of party” to support Joe Biden’s latest sanctions against Russia, which target some of the country’s largest banks and more elite Russian families.“There may be some economic consequences to such sanctions, given Russia’s significant role in world energy markets,” Obama acknowledged. “But that’s a price we should be willing to pay to take a stand on the side of freedom.” 24 Feb 202220.56House speaker Nancy Pelosi applauded Joe Biden’s latest round of sanctions against Russia in response to Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine, expressing support for the Ukrainian people.“The leadership of President Biden and our allies to demonstrate overwhelming resolve is crucial in this moment of heartbreak and suffering for the Ukrainian people,” Pelosi said in a statement. “We are united with unprecedented strength and coordination in our commitment to Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity.”Pelosi noted that House members received a briefing from the Biden administration on the Ukraine crisis today and will receive a classified, in-person briefing next week.“President Biden has made clear throughout Russia’s escalation that we will continue to impose costs on Russia that will leave it weakened in every way,” Pelosi said. “The United States Congress joins President Biden and all Americans in praying for the Ukrainian people.”",,,,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e1a7ea66167c89273960a25ff1e6d1955c4100fd/0_0_5019_3012/master/5019.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=6df6c3e44e27aa24473beec7eff87461

The invasion launched in the early hours is illegal, immoral and outrageous. It is, above all, a catastrophe for Ukraine: a massive assault by an aggressor with a well-documented ruthlessness and disdain for civilian lives. But as the country’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, warned: “The fate of not only our state is being decided, but also what Europe will be like.” A country that endured so many 20th-century traumas is now experiencing the continent’s biggest attack by one state on another since the second world war.  The unprovoked assault does not merely destroy the hopes of 1991. It is also a terrible blow to the broader international system. Vladimir Putin launched this attack even as the UN security council made its last desperate attempts to stave it off, and as the secretary general, António Guterres, pleaded with him publicly to call off his troops. It is true that the rules which prevailed after 1945 have been honoured perhaps as often in the breach as the observance. But the Russian president has spelt out his utter contempt for the teetering rules-based international order at its very heart. Russia claimed for months that it would not invade; its assurances that it will not occupy Ukraine are worth nothing. Even on its own supposed logic, the request for military help from the breakaway “republics” in the east cannot explain why troops are advancing from the north and south, and bombarding targets across the country. Mr Putin says that he wants to “demilitarise” and “de-nazify” a democratic country that freely chose its Jewish president. Kyiv believes his aim is to topple the government and install a puppet regime. How far the Russian president goes may be determined in large part by the Ukrainian response, and the costs its military can inflict. Mr Putin warned against other countries “meddling”, with the chilling warning that otherwise there would be “consequences you have never encountered in your history” – a barely coded nuclear threat – though Ukraine has long known it will fight alone, albeit strengthened by the recent influx of arms and advice. A brave minority in Russia have publicly decried this war. Even allowing for his work to insulate his country – amassing foreign currency, reducing western imports and increasing links with China and others – it is likely to pay for this assault with a weakened economy, increasing isolation, a reinvigorated Nato and a bitterly anti-Russian Ukraine. Though state media is pumping out propaganda, and internet censors threatened others with fines if they used non-official sources in their reporting, Mr Putin has done strikingly little to prepare the public for the invasion, or its costs. Yet a president who has twinned aggression abroad with repression at home seems indifferent not only to those costs, but also to the public response to them. Ukrainians now need and deserve the staunchest support. Those who flee must be given a true welcome by western Europe as well as neighbouring countries. But the big question is what price Ukraine’s backers are willing to pay. The UK and EU promised “massive” sanctions, but hours after the invasion, states were still bickering over how far to go. A further hike in energy prices could tip countries into rampant inflation and potentially recession, with the danger of political destabilisation and further division as citizens struggle to get by. Mr Putin has reason to believe that he can weather the reaction. Nord Stream 2 is now on hold; yet its construction began just one year after Russia annexed Crimea. Ukraine’s friends must make clear that this time is different, with a sustained as well as large-scale response. Serious attempts to counter Moscow’s aggression must start now, but will be the work of years. It will take years, too, to understand the new era on which we are all now embarking.",/p/kzbey,97.0,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/feb/24/the-guardian-view-on-putins-war-in-ukraine-a-bleak-new-beginning#comments,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/178c7cf41faeda1c4f9a41340d669907f68ce7c3/0_99_2841_1704/master/2841.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=6af9cc4840dd6073a4728d50ded6fc74

It is proof of his utter disregard for the health and wealth of the people of Russia and Ukraine. He is a tyrant prepared to take lives, destroy infrastructure and rob his own citizens in the name of a demented imperialist dream. The economic sanctions that the UK, its allies and partners enforce must be as severe as possible. The aim should be to cut Russia out of the western economic system, targeting the finance, energy, technology and defence sectors as well as individuals linked to Putin and the Russian government. The effects should be deep and long-lasting. This confrontation will last for years into the future. And here at home, after years of stubborn inaction, the government must now finally expunge corrupt Russian money from the UK. We must close the cracks and loopholes through which the tentacles of corrupt finance reach into our economy and democracy.  While sanctions are essential, we know that Putin’s concerns go far beyond the depth of his pockets, as shown by his willingness to act despite western threats of economic pain. Russia has been preparing for sanctions for at least two years. So, to defeat Russian aggression, we need to do more than attack Putin’s bank balance. While sanctions must be as comprehensive as possible, we need a broader response to face down his aggression. To defeat Putin, we need to unite against the ideology of Putinism. This is an ideology of authoritarianism, imperialism and ethno-nationalism. It is not unique to Russia. This ideology is emulated by despots and dictators around the world: leaders in China, the Middle East and beyond will be watching the strength of the west’s response to this invasion as they plot their next moves. Russia’s attack will have long-term implications for the security of Europe. If Putin is successful in the short term, the new frontline to Russian aggression will widen to include Poland, Romania, Slovakia and Hungary, as well as Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. We must work with our Nato and European allies and partners to bolster our continent’s defence and security and show strength, unity and resolve. But the opposition to Putinism needs to be broader than the G7, the EU or Nato. We need to rally the world against this threat and widen the international coalition that will oppose this grievous act of war, and counter Putin’s ideology of nationalistic expansion. We need to ensure that other global players such as India oppose the terrible precedent set by Putin’s invasion of a sovereign UN member state and his attempt to change national borders through military force. Can anyone in Russia stop Putin now? | Angus RoxburghRead more We must be clear that our opposition is to Putin and his gangster regime, not ordinary Russian people. Many of them will be feeling deeply uneasy as Russian troops wade across their nearest neighbour’s border, the home of many of their family and friends. Internal opposition to Putin’s deranged expansionism is the best hope of ending it. It’s imperative that we speak directly to them, making the argument for democracy, freedom and the right to self-determination, and never allowing our opposition to Putin to obscure our desire for friendship and peace with Russian people. It’s essential that we convince aspiring despots around the world that the Russian regime’s slide into imperialism is a historic mistake. Any victory will be pyrrhic in the long term, just as the invasion of Hungary in 1956, Czechoslovakia in 1968 and Afghanistan in 1979 all turned out to be failures in the end. The result of invasion is always brutal destruction, with civilians caught in the middle paying a terrible price. It is a moral imperative that we continue to help Ukraine to defend itself by providing defensive equipment alongside political, diplomatic and financial support. The Russian regime’s invasion of Ukraine signals the end of the post-cold war era. Nobody knows what comes next. The effects of this moment will depend as much on our response to this aggression as it will on the aggression itself. The response of the UK, its allies and its partners has to be strong not weak, united not divided, and strategic rather than short term. Our values of democracy and freedom must defeat Putinism in the end. David Lammy is the Labour MP for Tottenham and shadow foreign secretary

Photograph: Kevin Lamarque/Reuters",Joe Biden,"Thursday, 24 February 2022",2022-02-24,What can the west do about Russia invading Ukraine?,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/24/russia-invading-ukraine-putin-nato-what-can-west-do,"In the wake of what the Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, described as Russia’s “fully fledged invasion of Ukraine”, the west has to decide how to respond to what France’s Emmanuel Macron has called a turning point in European history. Yet can the west now offer Ukraine more than a mixture of prayers, sanctions and diplomatic demarches? Throughout this conflict western intelligence has shown it has been able to predict Putin’s next step, but less capable of stopping it. Boris Johnson told the Ukrainian people “we are with you”, but what this western solidarity means in practice is now up for debate.  The 30-nation Nato alliance will stick to its pledge that it will never send forces to protect Ukraine as a non-Nato member. Backbench Tory calls to give Ukraine air support have no support in Nato. Instead the west will test Russia’s resolve through tough sanctions and by some countries providing arms if there is a resistance. The coordinated sanctions in Washington, London, Berlin and Brussels being announced on Thursday are billed as massive, but Putin sits on a $600bn (£450bn) war chest and will benefit from oil prices soaring past $100 a barrel. That makes him less dependent on the west to raise capital than five years ago, and such is his dominance of the Russian media that the chances of internal protests pressurising, let alone toppling, the 69-year-old president look minimal. The oligarchs may complain if sanctions are placed on them, but Putin is in too deep to retreat. One London-based diplomat said this week after viewing Russia’s televised and cowed national security meeting: “We used to talk about Putin’s inner circle. There is no inner circle. There is only Putin.” Another said: “The only thing that will change Russian public opinion is the mothers of Russia seeing the bodybags.” Nikolai Petrov from the Chatham House thinktank warned “all infrastructure of political opponents and opposition has been destroyed, making it much easier for the Kremlin to to mobilise public opinion”. 01:56Russia has invaded Ukraine: what we know so far – video report Dire predictions by the British of Putin being mired in a battlefield quagmire will now be tested. Many Ukrainians appear on western media to attest that Putin has underestimated Ukraine’s will to fight. They insist they will not tolerate a puppet government loyal to Moscow. But the long queues of traffic fleeing Kyiv in the westward direction speaks to another story. It is as likely that Ukraine’s prisons will be filled with dissidents. In the short term there will be a debate, including in Germany, about whether to arm the resistance, with some Green party and CDU leaders already advocating this. The German foreign minister, Annalena Baerbock, at the weekend said this was not the moment for Germany to make a 180-degree turn on such a strategic policy. Yet the debate is live. The former German defence minister Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer said: “I’m so angry at us for historically failing. After Georgia, Crimea and Donbas, we have not prepared anything that would have really deterred Putin.” Keir Giles, also from Chatham House, urged the west to be cautious. “Looking at Russia’s 100% success record on suppressing resistance movements in territories it has occupied – often using medieval levels of savagery and inflicting terror on the civilian population – we ask what would aid to a resistance achieve and would it make the situation better worse or better.” The images of destruction in Aleppo, Grozny and Afghanistan show how merciless the Russian military can be. Stoltenberg has said that it is a matter for individual nations to decide the help they provide to any resistance. But the risks are high. In his speech announcing the invasion, Putin warned outsiders tempted to interfere that there would be “consequences you have never encountered in your history” – a chilling veiled reference to nuclear war. There is also a danger that an insurgency would exacerbate a refugee crisis likely to be triggered across central Europe. Plans are in infancy in the EU’s Frontex border agency to prepare for the arrival of hundreds of thousands of refugees. Some diplomats are optimistic that, unlike with Syria in 2015, there will not be a political backlash, pointing out many Ukrainians have already been welcomed to Europe. As many as 15,000 Ukrainians already live in Berlin. But autocrats have learned that refugees are weapons of war. The British foreign secretary, Liz Truss, has clearly indicated that there is a serious risk that Putin, judging by his words, will not stop at Ukraine, but wants to restore Russia’s empire, and remove western forces from all former Warsaw pact countries. Ben Wallace, the defence secretary, said Putin had gone “full tonto”, and almost every western politician who returned from Moscow was disturbed by his demeanour and inability to focus on realistic solutions to the crisis. It means once Ukraine is swallowed by Putin, Russia will be able to station forces – land, air and missile – in bases in western Ukraine as well as Belarus, which has effectively lost independence. He may not invade the Baltic states, but he is in a better strategic position to demand a retreat by Nato to Warsaw pact boundaries and a land corridor through Poland to link Kaliningrad, the headquarters of the Russian Baltic fleet. It will mean high defence spending, less dependence on Russian energy and more troops on Nato’s frontiers. Finland and Sweden may seek to join Nato. If Putin wanted less Nato, he may get more. Finally, the west has to confront questions about the validity of the whole postwar diplomatic security architecture. On Wednesday night UN diplomats gathered to condemn Russia at an emergency meeting, one chaired by Russia, this month’s presidents of the UN security council. It symbolised the degree to which the UN has become utterly compromised. But there may have been one diplomatic voice in New York that will disturb the west most – that of the Chinese envoy. In his brief remarks he remained studiously on the fence, refusing to condemn Russia and knowing the west’s anguish may provide it with nothing but opportunities ahead.",,,,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9bae7b2ea8c4487ad6fbf0ff6947592c5c109652/0_170_3104_1862/master/3104.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=d490632a8c466a12ebf031cbbc3bdabd

Boris Johnson said western allies “will agree a massive package of economic sanctions designed in time to hobble the Russian economy” – expected to be outlined to House of Commons at 5pm on Thursday.  But Davis said that even the most “ferocious sanctions … are no longer a deterrent, they are a punishment” and that the invasion of Ukraine meant Vladimir Putin had “effectively declared war on the west”. Davis tweeted: “Therefore if we do not provide military support, more than 40 million Ukrainians will go from living in a democracy to living under a brutal dictatorship. “It is far too late to get boots on the ground, but it is not too late to provide air support to the Ukrainian army, which may neutralise Putin’s overwhelming armoured superiority.” Davis said the air support should be confined to the airspace over Ukraine, and based on a request from Ukraine’s president, saying this “should be perfectly legal under almost any interpretation of international law”. He added: “There are no zero-risk options. If we do not act militarily, then Nato will be significantly weakened and we must fear for the safety of every state that borders Russia.” Tobias Ellwood, the chair of the defence select committee, said a Nato division should have been stationed in Ukraine as a deterrent. Ukraine is not a Nato member, but has requested membership. “If Kyiv falls, history will ask why the west didn’t do more?” Ellwood told the BBC. “Six months ago I called for a division, a Nato division, to be moved into Ukraine. That is what Ukrainians were requesting, and that would have deterred this invasion. 01:56Russia has invaded Ukraine: what we know so far – video report “That would have been enough to make Putin think twice. But we didn’t do that, we actually did the opposite. We declared that we would not send any Nato troops into Ukraine. We parked that away.” The former minister Stephen Hammond also called for the UK to consider using further military deterrent. “We must stand with Ukraine at this time of continental crisisand ensure Russian aggression does not go unpunished. We must work with our allies to impose tougher sanctions and a no-fly zone,” he said. Russia has significant advantages in air power: its total air force has 1,172 combat aircraft against Ukraine’s 124, according to the International Institute for Strategic Studies thinktank. Russian invasion of Ukraine Ukraine has sought to modernise its military over the past year, receiving Javelin anti-tank missiles from the US, shorter range anti-tank weapons from the UK and a small number of TB2 drones from Turkey. However, the bulk of its equipment dates back to the Soviet era and will be familiar to Russian generals. Alicia Kearns, a Conservative MP and former senior communications officer at the Ministry of Defence, said Britain providing defensive support in Ukrainian airspace should be “on the table and under discussion”. She said this would not be a move taken lightly, as it could mean Russia “shooting British airmen and women out of the sky”. Kearns said the move would be contingent on “meaningful intelligence” suggesting it would “be effective” at curtailing the Russian advance. “We know that Putin has a lot of anti-aircraft ground-to-air missiles,” she said. “He might not have any qualms about taking out British troops. If we went in, it would have to be with other Nato allies – a great number. Boris Johnson promises massive sanctions to ‘hobble’ Russian economyRead more “The alternative is, of course, the UK could put anti-aircraft missiles in neighbouring countries, but that also runs the risk of taking us into overt war with Russia. Kearns added it was “too late to put boots on the ground” but that if Russian troops continued their advance on Kyiv, the UK should consider cyberstrikes on the Kremlin and state firms “within the week”. She also suggested Turkey should be encouraged to deny the Russian navy passage through the Bosphorus straits, a key access point between the Black Sea and Mediterranean. Tom Tugendhat, the chair of the foreign affairs select committee, said weak sanctions such as those announced on Monday “just encourage others to believe we are weak because we’re clearly not willing to do anything serious. “So what that did, I’m afraid, on Monday was it didn’t deter but encouraged, because it gave the suggestion or made clear that we weren’t wiling to do anything serious. “If we are going to do sanctions, as I say, we need to do them extremely hard and extremely early.”",,,,

Peace depends on it,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/feb/24/putin-war-russia-ukraine-china-xi-jinping,"All Europe must have awoken this morning and heard the news with horror. Sometimes history refuses to die. The fate of 44 million Ukrainians at the mercy of Russia and its vast army is appalling to contemplate. Indeed, so wild and mendacious are the utterances of Vladimir Putin in the past 24 hours that they suggest a dictator deranged and out of control. It is precisely the danger that was forecast by strategic theorists at the dawn of the nuclear age. As of this morning, Putin’s declared intention is to “demilitarise” Ukraine and assert Russia’s de facto sovereignty over the Donbas east of the country. The latter is chiefly an exaggeration of what Russia has done covertly since 2014. The former is hard to see other than as formal conquest. This is no longer some border dispute or separatist uprising, but the concerted assault of a great power on a substantial neighbour.  Ukraine’s friends and sympathisers have been fulsome in offering comfort and “support”. Ever since 1989, western Europe has been eager, perhaps over-eager, to welcome former Soviet bloc countries into its embrace. Many thought this a mistake. Offering Nato and EU membership up to Russia’s border was certain to inflame that country’s well-known sense of insecurity, but the risk was taken. At the same time any idea of including Ukraine and Georgia in that embrace was rightly thought a risk too far. Putin has now grotesquely proved that risk. Russia’s attack on Ukraine might be thought an aggression so outrageous as to outrank any consideration of treaties and alliances. But though the west has offered Kyiv ferocious moral support and will of course respond with humanitarian aid, it has been adamant that it is not obliged by Nato to fight in its cause. That must be sensible. But at such times words must be used with care. Belligerent support can look uncomfortably close to hypocrisy – as some Ukrainians are pleading. The west must distinguish outright condemnation of Russia from crowd-pleasing verbal aggression. Reality is sober. For Nato’s armies to go to war with Russia in Ukraine would for sure escalate to an atrocious cost in lives and destruction. We should also remember that the west and Nato have a dreadful recent record of such interventions, of an inability to judge their worth and when and how to end them. No war is like any other. Ukraine is not Cuba or Afghanistan or Syria – any more than Putin is a Hitler or Kyiv’s inhabitants Nazis. I heard not one speaker in Britain’s parliament this week counselling sobriety or peace. Belligerence – even from Keir Starmer – had not just the best tunes but the only ones. Inflicting that pathetic and ineffective weapon of modern interventionism, sanctions, is not toughness but the opposite. It is pretend toughness – short of actually getting tough. That is the danger. The shriller the threats, the more cowardly seems the refusal to fight. This is not yet a critical moment in relations between Russia, or at least its leader, and the west. It is critical in relations between Russia and a Ukraine with which it has had a long and historically turbulent relationship. There is, or was, a way out: the Minsk agreement of 2015 between Kyiv and Moscow, recognising Donbas autonomy. The failure of both sides to implement Minsk is the cause of the present collapse, but it cannot become the cause of some wider European conflagration. Serious talk is now known to be taking place on how to reach Putin, thrashing demented in his isolated citadel. He apparently listens to almost no one, but he does listen to China’s Xi Jinping and a tiny circle of rich cronies. It is obscene that peace in eastern Europe should depend on such people. But they must be reached. That is the true failure of European diplomacy over the past 30 years. Simon Jenkins is a Guardian columnist

Shortly after reports broke of explosions near Kyiv, the US president, Joe Biden, accused his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, of choosing a “premeditated war that will bring a catastrophic loss of life and human suffering”.  “The prayers of the world are with the people of Ukraine tonight as they suffer an unprovoked and unjustified attack by Russian military forces,” he said. Russia alone is responsible for the death and destruction this attack will bring, and the United States and its Allies and partners will respond in a united and decisive way. The world will hold Russia accountable.— President Biden (@POTUS) February 24, 2022 “Russia alone is responsible for the death and destruction this attack will bring, and the United States and its allies and partners will respond in a united and decisive way,” Biden said. “The world will hold Russia accountable.” Biden said he had spoken to the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, on the phone shortly after the attacks began, and said he had told him he and allied partners would be “imposing severe sanctions on Russia” once the G7 leaders had met on Thursday. “We will continue to provide support and assistance to Ukraine and the Ukrainian people.” A joint statement issued by the 27 heads of state and government of the EU warned Russia that they would later on Thursday agree on “further restrictive measures that will impose massive and severe consequences on Russia for its action, in close coordination with our transatlantic partners.” The UK prime minister, Boris Johnson, told the House of Commons that the UK and its allies would respond with “a massive package of sanctions” that will “hobble the Russian economy”. He said: “Ukraine is a country that for decades has enjoyed freedom and democracy and the right to choose its own destiny. We and the world cannot allow that freedom just to be snuffed out. We cannot and will not just look away.” I am appalled by the horrific events in Ukraine and I have spoken to President Zelenskyy to discuss next steps. President Putin has chosen a path of bloodshed and destruction by launching this unprovoked attack on Ukraine. The UK and our allies will respond decisively.— Boris Johnson (@BorisJohnson) February 24, 2022 A Downing Street spokesperson said the prime minister had told Ukraine’s president he hoped his forces could resist the onslaught. France’s president, Emmanuel Macron, who had made a last ditch effort to broker peace through a summit between Putin and Biden, was in contact with Zelenskiy on his mobile phone early on Thursday. He said: “France strongly condemns Russia’s decision to wage war on Ukraine. Russia must end its military operations immediately. “France stands in solidarity with Ukraine. It stands with the Ukrainians and works with its partners and allies to end the war.” In a statement, Germany’s chancellor, Olaf Scholz, said: “Germany condemns in the strongest possible terms this unscrupulous act by President Putin. Our solidarity goes out to Ukraine and its people.” The world “will not forget this day of shame”, Germany’s foreign minister, Annalena Baerbock, said. 00:54Ukraine: Russian missile strikes reported in Kharkiv and Kyiv – video Mario Draghi, Italy’s prime minister, who has until now been cautious over imposing the most hard-hitting sanctions on Russia, suggested the EU would be unified in an immediate and tough response.He said: “The Italian government condemns Russia’s attack on Ukraine. It is unjustified and unjustifiable. “Italy is close to the Ukrainian people and institutions in this dramatic moment. We are working with European and Nato allies to respond immediately, with unity and determination.” Japan’s prime minister, Fumio Kishida, said his government strongly condemned Russia’s one-sided aggression. A virtual meeting of the G7, the world’s seven biggest economies, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the UK and the US, is scheduled for later on Thursday. 01:56Russia has invaded Ukraine: what we know so far – video report Ursula von der Leyen and Charles Michel, the presidents of the European Commission and European Council, issued a joint statement in which they promised financial and humanitarian assistance for Kyiv and vowed to “impose massive and severe consequences on Russia for its action”. Von der Leyen said Putin was responsible “for bringing war back to Europe”, describing the Russian leader’s behaviour as “barbaric”, as she outlined the scale and scope of the punitive measures planned. She said: “We will hold President Putin accountable for that. With this package, we will target strategic sectors of the Russian economy by blocking their access to key technologies and markets. “We will weaken Russia’s economic base and its capacity to modernise. In addition, we will freeze Russian assets in the EU and stop the access of Russian banks to the European financial market.” 01:59 'Among the darkest hours for Europe': EU reacts as Russia invades Ukraine – video EU leaders will meet in Brussels on Thursday evening to discuss the long-prepared “full monty” package of sanctions against Russia, which have been designed to cripple the country’s economy. They range from cutting Russia out of the Swift payment system that lubricates world trade, to imposing export controls on critical goods such as high-tech components that the country cannot replace in the fields of artificial intelligence and weaponry, quantum computers, lasers and space. The foreign ministers for Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania said in a joint statement that the agreed measures had to include “disengaging Russia from Swift”. They said: “We would need to urgently provide Ukrainian people with weapons, ammunition and any other kind of military support to defend itself.” Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, announced that an alliance summit will be held on Friday, with Finland and Sweden in attendance as non-members. He said: “It will be a new reality, a new Europe after the invasion we saw today” Following an emergency meeting of the North Atlantic council, the alliance’s political decision making body, new guidance had also been issued to to its military commanders to allow them to more quickly move military forces around Europe, he said. He said: “We have already increased and we are increasing the presence of Nato troops in the eastern part of the alliance. “We do not have Nato troops in Ukraine and we do not have plans to send Nato troops to Ukraine.” We strongly condemn Russia´s unjustified attack on Ukraine.In these dark hours, our thoughts are with Ukraine and the innocent women, men and children as they face this unprovoked attack and fear for their lives.We will hold the Kremlin accountable.— Ursula von der Leyen (@vonderleyen) February 24, 2022 Stoltenberg, speaking in Brussels, said that Russia was waging war with air and missile attacks, ground forces and special forces from multiple directions, targeting the military infrastructure and major urban centres. He said: “This is a brutal act of war. Our thoughts are with the brave people of Ukraine.“Sadly, what we have warned against for months has come to pass. Despite all calls on Russia to change course and tireless efforts to seek a diplomatic solution.“Peace in our continent has been shattered. We now have war in Europe, on a scale and of a type we thought belong to history. “This is a grave moment for the security of Europe.” 02:28 'Peace on our continent has been shattered': Nato chief on the Russian invasion of Ukraine – video Spain’s prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, tweeted: “The government of Spain condemns Russia’s aggression against Ukraine and expresses its solidarity with the Ukrainian government and its people. I remain in close contact with our partners and allies in the European Union and Nato to coordinate our response.” The United Nations secretary general António Guterres, who had urged Putin just before the assault began to stop his troops from attacking, tweeted an updated plea. “Under the present circumstances, I must change my appeal: President Putin, in the name of humanity, bring your troops back to Russia,” he said. “This conflict must stop now.” 0'President Putin, in the name of humanity, bring your troops back to Russia,' says UN chief – video",,,,

Jens Stoltenberg, the Nato secretary general, chaired a virtual summit of 30 leaders on Friday, where the agreement was made to amass forces in eastern Europe.  “No one should be fooled by the Russian government’s barrage of lies,” the leaders said in a joint statement. “We are now making significant additional defensive deployments of forces to the eastern part of the alliance.” EU and UK announce sanctions targeting Vladimir Putin and Sergei LavrovRead more Stoltenberg said Russia’s invasion was “the gravest threat to Euro-Atlantic security in decades”. “Russia has shattered peace in Europe. The people of Ukraine are fighting for their freedom in the face of Russia’s unprovoked invasion. We deplore the tragic loss of life, enormous human suffering and destruction.” James Heappey, a UK defence minister, earlier said the UK would send further armed forces to Estonia “earlier than planned” to reinforce the Nato ally. The Royal Welsh battlegroup will be arriving in the country to double force levels. Heappey also revealed that a total of 1,000 UK troops were on standby to support Ukraine’s neighbours with refugee responses. “The 1,000 troops that are on standby are there to support Hungary, Slovakia, Romania and Poland with the expected humanitarian challenges that they will face as people make their way out of Ukraine,” he said. However, Heappey also warned against any potential meeting between Russian and Nato troops, saying it could become “existential”. Speaking in parliament, he said: “We must all in this house be clear that British and Nato troops should not, must not, play an active role in Ukraine. We must all be clear what the risk of miscalculation could be and how existential that could very quickly become if people miscalculate and things escalate unnecessarily.” During the debate, Heappey was pressed by MPs to support a no-fly zone across Ukraine, which he rejected because of the risk of Nato forces encountering Russian ones. In an earlier exchange on BBC’s Radio 4 Today programme, the Ukrainian MP Lesia Vasylenko pleaded with Ben Wallace, the defence secretary, for the UK and the US to close airspace above Ukraine “in order for these casualties not to escalate”. However, Wallace said this would constitute a direct act of aggression towards Russia, which would prompt a response and result in “war across Europe”, as any attack on the UK would implicate all other Nato members. Wallace said: “To do a no-fly zone I would have to put British fighter jets against Russian; Nato would have to declare war on Russia.” He added: “I cannot and won’t trigger a European war but I will help Ukraine fight every street with every piece of equipment we can support them.” Wallace said the UK had supported accelerating Ukraine’s Nato membership, which would have triggered military intervention from fellow members, but that other countries had been concerned by the pace. He added that other democratic countries had a “moral duty” to continue to arm the Ukrainian forces since it was widely acknowledged that Putin “won’t stop at Ukraine” and would proceed to train his sights on Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, as he “doesn’t believe the Baltic states are countries”.He told Sky News: “What you’re seeing on your cameras today is illogical. Putin didn’t need to do this, he didn’t need to occupy a sovereign country. None of the reasons why he would do that stack up. He’s not doing something that’s logical, he’s doing something about his ego and his legacy.” As the EU and UK decided to bring in sanctions against Vladmir Putin, the Russian president, and his foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, Boris Johnson and allies from the Joint Expeditionary Force alliance including Sweden, Norway and the Netherlands agreed on the need to go further after a meeting on Thursday morning. Downing Street said the leaders “agreed that more sanctions were needed, including focusing on President Putin’s inner circle, building on the measures that had already been agreed”. It said Johnson had made clear to Nato allies that the UK “stood ready for any further request from Nato’s supreme allied commander Europe to go further with military support to Nato from UK armed forces”. Keir Starmer, the Labour leader, has said he believes “further financial restrictions” against Russia are needed. He said if Johnson brought forward tougher sanctions on Russia, they would be voted through parliament “very, very quickly” with Labour’s support. Liz Truss, the foreign secretary, briefed MPs on the prospect of further sanctions next week and also summoned the Belarus ambassador to London, Maxim Yermalovich, to the Foreign Office. He was told members of its ruling elite would be sanctioned as a result of their role in facilitating the invasion of Ukraine by Russian forces. James Cleverly, the Europe minister, said afterwards: “The UK condemns the role Belarus is playing in the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Belarus must stop supporting Russia’s illegal and unprovoked actions.”",,,,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dff2bc51956c4f5fc8fa7b614998e9bca052f89d/496_692_5034_3020/master/5034.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=69f56ca2abbae76d4d62bfd7c7340b52

The US commentator who made that quip meant that events currently unfolding in Ukraine will be remembered for many decades to come, that future generations of schoolchildren will be called to memorise the date of 24 February 2022. But it’s true in another, darker sense too. For this is a grimly retro war. Russian troops marching across an international border, closing in on a European capital? Families sheltering in underground stations, children parted from their fathers, civilians donning uniforms and reaching for rifles, vowing to fight to the death for their homeland? An actual invasion of one European country by another? Footage of such events looks strange in colour: it should be in grainy black and white. Because Europe was meant to have left such events behind, if not in the 1940s – when the Nazi bombardment of Kyiv began at 4am one day in 1941, rather than the 5am hour chosen on Thursday by Vladimir Putin – then later in the 20th century, when Soviet tanks rolled into Budapest in 1956 or Prague in 1968. Instead, history is back – confronting us with a choice we imagined we’d made long ago.  The choice was set out as starkly as it could be, by the leaders of the two countries now locked in uneven combat. Putin spoke twice, his first address repeatedly described as rambling and incoherent, but no less chilling for that. Between the two appearances, Putin set out a justification for invasion that, naturally, rested on lies. He claimed Moscow had to invade, to save eastern Ukraine’s Russian speakers from a genocidal threat that did not exist. He would rescue Ukraine from rule by “neo-Nazis”, an odd way to describe a country whose president and recent prime minister are both Jews, both democrats. But underneath the spurious defences lay the Putin worldview. His objection was not, as Putin’s western apologists on the far right and far left would have it, merely to Nato expansion, but something rather more fundamental. Putin argued that Ukraine was not a proper country, implying that of the states born out of the collapsed Soviet Union, only one was real and legitimate: Russia. All the rest were confections, whose right to exist was hazy and to be determined by Putin himself, by force of arms if necessary. Taking him by his word and by his deeds, Putin believes he has the right to redraw the map of Europe, and to do so in blood. Not long afterwards, Ukraine’s Volodymyr Zelenskiy also addressed the Russian people, and he too spoke in Russian. It was a speech for the ages, one that deserves to be read now and long after this crisis is over. For it did not just plead his people’s case, though it did that: “Lots of you have relatives in Ukraine. You know our character, our principles, what matters to us.” It did not just make the case against all wars: “People lose their loved ones and themselves.” It specifically set out the principle at stake: “international law, the right to determine your own future”. 01:18Kyiv apartment building hit as Ukrainians fight off Russian attacks – video report This, then, is the choice. Do we want to live in the world described by Zelenskiy, where democratic states are protected by an international system of rules, however flawed and inconsistent that system might be? Or do we want to live in Putin’s world, governed by the law of the jungle and where the only right is might? We think we know which side we’re on. We want to stand with those bleary-eyed children, clutching their colouring books as they bed down in a Kyiv subway station. We tell ourselves we stand with them and against Putin and his war of aggression. But do we? Because Putin had hardly kept his worldview secret until now. On the contrary, he had acted on it at least three times in the past 15 years, each time paying little price. He seized a chunk of Georgia in 2008 and of Ukraine in 2014, to say nothing of his decision to adopt the Assad regime’s murderous war against the Syrian people as his own a year later. We may have forgotten about all that – the Russian dissident Garry Kasparov laments the “amnesia of the west” – but Putin had not. He noted the western shrug that greeted his annexation of Crimea: how, just four years later, Russia was cheerfully hosting the football World Cup. There was no beefing up of Ukrainians’ defences, so that they might protect themselves against this moment. There was no clearout of oligarch money from Londongrad. Putin understood the signal: it was a green light. And what are we proposing to do to stop him now, even as he invades his neighbour? The latest rounds of economic sanctions are hardly crippling, not when Moscow has friends, starting with China, that are willing to soften the blow. But even if the measures were stronger, there’s no guarantee they would work. Both Bashar al-Assad and the regime in Tehran have faced sanctions for years; they’re still standing, their behaviour barely changed. The problem is an obvious one: Putin does not care if his people suffer. He’s priced in the hit to his oligarch pals, just as he’s priced in the loss of Russian military lives. For him, conquering Ukraine – and removing the example of a democratic neighbour that might show Russians a different life is possible – is worth it. The west has a duty to help defend Ukraine – and to help Russia by ensuring its defeat | Keir GilesRead more But if confronting Putin economically is ineffective, confronting him militarily is barely plausible or palatable. The Russian dictator was at pains to remind the west that his is a “powerful nuclear state”. Analysts say that Putin does not see Russia’s nuclear capability as theoretical: it is absorbed into his military strategy. No one would want to tangle with such a man, not least as he seems to drift ever further away from stable rationality. Apparently modest options – perhaps enforcing a no-fly zone over Ukraine – run into the same problems: it would mean Nato being at war with Russia. We can hope for a palace coup against the tsar. We can send our solidarity and admiration to those Russian anti-war protesters brave enough to take to the streets, hoping they might somehow topple the autocrat ruining so many lives. But these are no more than wishes. The grimmer prospect is that Putin understands something about the 21st century few of us want to face: that this is an age of impunity, especially for those who have a vast and deadly arsenal but no shame. That is what’s at stake in this moment. Beijing understands it: if Russia can take Ukraine, why can’t China snatch Taiwan? Kseniia understands it too. She is the young Kyiv resident who, after a night in a subway station, told the BBC: “We are like a shield for Europe and for the world. We fight for the freedom of the world.” She is right – and yet she, and her country, are terribly alone. Jonathan Freedland is a Guardian columnist

As his hopes of a quick victory evaporated in the face of fierce resistance by Ukrainian soldiers and armies of citizen volunteers, Russia’s president was deserted by his key ally, China, and had his ultimatum demanding Kyiv’s surrender defiantly brushed aside by Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy.  In perhaps the most striking development, Germany announced on Saturday night that it would supply Ukrainian troops with 1,000 anti-tank weapons as well as 500 Stinger missiles from its own military reserves. 02:14 Zelenskiy and Johnson welcome move to cut off Russian banks from Swift – video “The Russian assault on Ukraine marks a turning point,” Germany’s chancellor, Olaf Scholz, said, signalling a major shift in his country’s postwar military stance. “It threatens our entire postwar order. In this situation it is our duty to support Ukraine to the best of our ability in its defence against the invasive army of Vladimir Putin. Germany stands closely on the side of Ukraine.” Significantly, the German government was also said to be bowing to intense pressure from Britain, the US and Canada to ban Russia from the crucial Swift banking payments system after repeated appeals from Kyiv for the west to do so. Sources in Berlin said German ministers’ views were shifting on the issue and they were actively discussing measures that “would hit the right people”, having previously resisted, partly because of fears that a ban would affect the flow of funds to aid agencies in Russia. Mikhailo, aged 5, waits in an undergound shelter during a bombing alert in Kyiv yesterday. Photograph: Daniel Leal/AFP/Getty Images In further blows to Putin, Hungary’s leader, Viktor Orbán, long seen as friendly towards Moscow, abandoned his support, saying he would back all EU sanctions against Russia, while Turkey was reported to be considering blocking the passage of Russian naval vessels into the Black Sea. As a global diplomatic outcry intensified, Russia’s defence ministry ominously announced it was ordering “all units to advance in all sectors” as it accused Ukraine of refusing to negotiate. And in a desperate attempt to restore a positive narrative in the information war, the Kremlin banned street protests and restricted access to social media such as Facebook. A growing list of Russian celebrities and influencers announced they backed global efforts to stop the war. Having held off Russian forces for two nights, morale in Kyiv remained high among Ukrainians of all ages and from all walks of life, as many queued to take up arms. Many also gleefully shared videos of unarmed civilians rushing into the road to stop advancing convoys and fearlessly berating Russian soldiers about why they had come to Ukraine. Around the country, Russian forces were not confirmed as having control of a single major city, while Zelenskiy remained in Kyiv and told Americans who offered to evacuate him: “The fight is here. I need ammunition, not a ride.” Adding to the sense of crisis enveloping the Kremlin, the US said it would send a further $350m (£260m) of military assistance to Ukraine, taking its total for the past 12 months to more than $1bn; Nato moved more troops and weaponry to eastern member states bordering Russia and Belarus; and a sporting boycott mushroomed, with Russia facing a ban from motor racing and Poland refusing to play a World Cup football game . YouTube barred the Russian state-owned media outlet RT and other Russian channels from receiving money for advertisements that run with their videos. Opposition to the invasion also spilled over into the UK’s Premier League football programme.

Photograph: Peter Byrne/PA The head coach of Chelsea, which is owned by the Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich – who last week was named in parliament as one of 35 oligarchs and “enablers” of the Putin regime – even suggested that he would be “happy to lose” Sunday’s Carabao Cup final against Liverpool. “Given the situation, that we have a war, this is simply not important enough,” said Thomas Tuchel. “It unfortunately will not help, but, if it would, I am happy to lose the match.” On Saturday night, Abramovich announced he was handing “stewardship” of the club to the trustees of its charitable foundation. In London, the Ministry of Defence announced that Challenger 2 tanks and armoured vehicles from the Royal Welsh Battlegroup had arrived in Estonia from Germany, with further equipment and about 1,000 troops following over the coming days. The defence secretary, Ben Wallace, said the aim was to stop invasions of Nato member states: “Alongside our Nato allies, these deployments constitute a credible deterrent to stop Russian aggression threatening the territorial sovereignty of member states.” On Saturday, Russian advances on major cities, including Kyiv, appeared to have slowed or ground to a halt. Ukraine’s defence ministry claimed Russia had suffered more than 3,000 casualties and that many other soldiers had been captured. UK and other diplomats said a decision by China to abstain rather than back its ally Russia in a UN resolution on the invasion was being viewed as a huge victory for the west. Beijing called on both Moscow and Kyiv to find a negotiated settlement. Ukraine’s health minister reported on Saturday that 198 people had been killed, including three children, and that more than 1,000 others had been wounded since the Russian offensive started before dawn on Thursday with massive air and missile strikes and troops forging into Ukraine from the north, east and south.

It does so by choice, out of timidity, greed and sloth. This has been the case for more than two decades. This is now the case in Ukraine. And this is why we lose.  When Russia’s mafioso-president murdered Alexander Litvinenko, invaded Georgia, abetted Syrian war crimes, annexed Crimea, sent mercenary killers to Libya and the Sahel, subverted America’s elections, waged cyber warfare, weaponised the internet and poisoned the Skripals, ensuing punishments were short-lived, ineffective or non-existent. Western politicians and businesses have known for years what kind of man Putin is. They knew what his rogue regime was capable of. Yet many pretended otherwise, or looked away, or took his money, as have far-right parties in France and Italy. They pretended he was normal. This pattern was repeated prior to the Ukraine invasion. Even as they deplored what they called the biggest security threat to Europe since 1945, western leaders failed to act with urgency on their own warnings. They pulled their punches. Now it’s too late. And this is why we lose. Ever since the Ukraine crisis blew up, the west has been on the defensive. It’s time to switch to “offense”, as American footballers say. If, for example, Putin has indeed grown “paranoid” and “irrational” – terms used last week by US and European officials to suggest he’s off his trolley – then, logically, there’s only one course of action. Having failed to prevent the invasion, the allies must seek regime change in Moscow. Putin must be toppled from his throne. Only decapitation can save Ukraine, the global order – and Russia itself. The west should publicly assist all those Russians who want new leadership in their country. Feed Putin’s paranoia. Erode his base. Make him fear his friends. Why are Joe Biden and Boris Johnson not demanding the release of Alexei Navalny, Russia’s most able opposition activist – the man Putin tried to kill with a nerve agent in 2020 and then imprisoned? Why not call for new, free elections? An anti-war protest in Saint Petersburg on Thursday after Vladimir Putin authorised military operations in Ukraine. Photograph: Anton Vaganov/Reuters Western leaders should tell patriotic Russians everywhere: take a leaf out of Ukraine’s 2014 revolutionary playbook, defy Putin’s police state (as during Moscow’s 2011 pro-democracy protests), and purge this Soviet era throwback. Will they do so? Unlikely. The same leaders who warn of unprecedented threats from an unhinged tsar appear fearful of provoking him. They worry about losing control, about unpredictable outcomes. The one thing that might prevent a prolonged war and avoid future collisions – helping Russians dump Putin – is the very thing they dare not do. And this is why we lose. Why was a pre-invasion offer of full Nato membership for Kyiv – if Putin failed to pull back – never discussed, let alone made? Ukraine joining Nato is supposedly what Ivan the Terrible #2 fears most. It might have created some leverage. Which genius in Washington decided to assure Putin that Nato forces would not fight for Ukraine if he attacked? It must have seemed like a green light. A little ambiguity about the allied response would not have hurt. Tobias Ellwood, Tory MP and former soldier, argued weeks ago that a limited number of Nato troops should be sent to Ukraine, to act as a tripwire for a Russian advance. Now calls for Nato air cover over Ukraine are similarly dismissed. Johnson, aping Churchill, spoke bullishly when visiting Kyiv about solidarity and deterring aggression. But actually doing something brave like deploying British troops there, and taking a risk, was a bridge too far for him. Poland and Lithuania, keenly aware of Putin’s inability to respect other people’s boundaries, proposed last week that Ukraine be fast-tracked into the EU. This offer should still be made. Meanwhile, recall Europe’s (and UK and US) ambassadors from Moscow, break off diplomatic relations, and declare a full-spectrum trade and banking embargo, including Russia’s vital oil and gas exports. Why has this not been done already? Putin is far beyond the pale. It is unlikely to happen. Because of all that dirty Russian money. Because Europe’s energy prices would rocket. Because investors and exporters would raise a stink. Because western politicians still pretend he’s “rational”. And this is why we lose. Could more have been done, sooner, to stop Putin? Certainly. Yet it also now appears he decided to invade days or weeks ago, no matter what anyone might say. France’s president, Emmanuel Macron, says he was personally “deceived”. Maybe there was just no stopping him. How to turn this around, even now? As in the Michael Caine film Get Carter, the order of the day must be: “Get Putin.” Forget the oligarchs. Aim punitive sanctions directly at him personally, at his money, and at elite politicians, officials and propagandists who sustain him. Arraign him for war crimes at the International Criminal Court. Issue national arrest warrants, using universal jurisdiction. Tell his fellow dictator, China’s Xi Jinping, to steer clear or risk collateral damage. Make a wanted poster of Putin’s mug. Cast him as a pariah, an international outlaw. Help the Ukrainian military fight him off by supplying weapons and aid. And then help Russian democrats bring him down as his military offensive falters and bodybags start to come home. There is no earthly reason why this twisted little coward should be allowed to go on causing global mayhem and misery. His fall would be a boon to the world. And yet, on past form, it probably won’t happen soon. He will survive, even as uncounted thousands perish. Why? Because we let him. The west is complicit in Putin’s tyranny. It always has been. And this is why we lose.",,,,

This has been so since the mid-1960s, when both east and west were grappling with the rapid expansion of strategic and the more ambitious tactical nuclear weapons. Western strategists tended to look for ways of deterring an adversary. This led to complex theories of controlled escalation, known as flexible response – still the central principle of Nato doctrine. At its core, Nato would seek to respond appropriately to a level of Soviet/Russian aggression. How all of the supposed signalling in the middle of a hot and dynamic war was supposed to work was often glossed over.  Soviet, and now Russian, concepts of warfare are different. You prevent a war by demonstrating or convincing a potential opponent that your armies will prevail. This implies that if impeded or resisted the application of military force will be rapidly intensified. The nuclear option is thus readily at hand and shown to be so. Deterrence against an attack is insured by promising defeat. A crucial distinction from mutual assured destruction. Prof Keith Hayward London Jonathan Freedland is right about the green light but not its cause. Invasion and war have become the accepted method by which major states impose their will on weaker ones. They are no longer a last resort when diplomatic efforts fail, but an accepted first resort, with the UN providing a convenient fig leaf to give spurious legality to some invasions and not others. We now live in a world in which sovereign states are no longer protected by an international system of rule. The UN principle of the right of states to self-determination as set out in international law has been completely superceded by the right to invade by the powerful. As in every war, it’s always the civilians and military personnel who pay with their lives, not the politicians who too easily pick invasion and war, not diplomacy and peace.Peter HallBarnburgh, Doncaster Russia’s aggression against Ukraine exposes the extraordinary failure of the UN security council to live up to its primary responsibility to maintain international peace and security. When, in 1990, Iraq invaded Kuwait, the security council was swift to act and adopt resolution 678, which authorised the use of “all necessary means” to halt that aggression and restore peace. The USSR representative at the time stated that “those who had breached the peace should know that all necessary means would indeed inexorably be used against them”. Of course, the situation is different today. The peace was broken by one of the permanent members of the security council, which are able to abuse their privileges and treat this body with disdain. Indeed, as reported in your article Moment that Putin thundered to war, drowning out last entreaties for peace, 24 February), Putin announced the start of Russia’s “special military operation” while an emergency session of the security council was under way. What we are witnessing here is not just a flagrant breach of international law but also a stark sense of resignation on the part of the other permanent members of the security council with respect to Ukraine’s occupation.Dr Aldo Zammit BordaReader in law, The City Law School, City, University of London Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

Widespread use of indiscriminate weapons such as multiple rocket launchers against civilian areas, as used on Monday in the city of Kharkiv, suggested that the Kremlin, having failed to land a knockout blow in the first days of the war, was prepared to unleash more desperate methods.  The prosecutor of the international criminal court said he would launch an investigation into possible war crimes or crimes against humanity in Ukraine.

Satellite photos showed long Russian columns heading towards Kyiv. The satellite imaging company Maxar published a picture of a 40-mile convoy of forces about 30 miles from the capital. Inside Kyiv, air raid sirens sounded as evening fell and several detonations were reported. Blasts were also heard in Mariupol on the coast of the Sea of Azov. However, Russian forces have yet to take any major Ukrainian city. Turkey said it would ban all warships from crossing the Bosphorus and Dardanelles straits leading to the Black Sea, blocking the route for at least four Russian vessels which are waiting to cross from the Mediterranean.

Photograph: MaxarTech/AFP/Getty Images The Élysée Palace said after a call between Emmanuel Macron and Vladimir Putin that the Russian president had said he was “willing to commit” to ending attacks on civilians and civil infrastructure while ceasefire talks were taking place between Russian and Ukrainian officials in Belarus. But on the fifth day of fighting and with Russian forces advancing more slowly than many analysts had expected, the Ukrainian interior ministry adviser Anton Herashchenko said on Monday Kharkiv had been “massively fired on”, leaving “dozens of dead and hundreds of wounded”. After a classified briefing from US intelligence in Washington, Senator Chris Murphy said on Twitter: “The ability to keep supply lines running to Ukraine remains alive, but Russia will try to encircle and cut off Kiev in the next several weeks. The fight for Kiev will be long and bloody and Ukrainians are rapidly preparing for street to street combat.” A school destroyed as a result of fighting not far from the centre of Kharkiv. Photograph: Sergey Bobok/AFP/Getty Images The talks between Russian and Ukrainian delegations near the Belarus-Ukraine border ended inconclusively, with national news agencies quoting officials as saying the negotiators would return to their respective capitals for consultations before embarking on a second round of talks in the coming days. The Ukrainian presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak described negotiations as “difficult” and said: “Unfortunately, the Russian side is still extremely biased regarding the destructive processes it launched.” The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, urged Russian troops to abandon their equipment and leave the battlefield to save their lives, claiming 4,500 were already dead. Russia’s nuclear forces were placed on high alert, it was announced on Monday, in line with Putin’s orders to his defence chiefs the day before, but it was unclear if the alert involved the movement of the country’s nuclear weapons, or the deployment of personnel to command and control facilities. Meanwhile Russia’s foreign ministry said on Monday that those supplying lethal weapons to Ukraine would bear responsibility should they be used during the war. Map A senior US intelligence official said the president of Belarus, Alexander Lukashenko, who has backed Putin’s military assault on Ukraine after earlier playing an intermediary role, could also send troops to help Russia in the next 24 hours. Western analysts also said they were alarmed by a referendum vote in pro-Russian Belarus that could result in nuclear weapons being stationed on the country’s soil for the first time since the fall of the Soviet Union.

The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said it had information that “Russian forces were operational near the site but had not entered it at the time of reporting”. The IAEA’s director general, Rafael Grossi, “stressed that any military or other action that could threaten the plant’s safety or security must be avoided”. At least 102 civilians in Ukraine have been killed, with 304 more wounded, but the real figure will be “considerably higher”, the UN human rights commissioner, Michelle Bachelet, said earlier on Monday. A US defence official said Russia had fired more than 350 missiles. Karim Khan, the ICC prosecutor, said he would open an investigation into possible war crimes or crimes against humanity in Ukraine, based both on a prior report by his predecessor in 2020, and on current military operations. Khan said he had already instructed his team to take steps to preserve evidence. Western officials said there would be “a requirement to record and capture” attacks on civilians to establish whether war crimes had been committed by the unnecessary targeting of civilians by Russian forces. At least seven were reported to have died after what appeared to be indiscriminate rocket strikes on Kharkiv on Monday, although an Ukrainian official said “dozens” had been killed. 04:14Inside Ukraine: life in a bunker as missiles fall on Kharkiv – video “I think we will be very attentive and alert to war crimes or breaches of international humanitarian law in this conflict,” said one official, although they said it was too soon comment whether they thought the attack on Kharkiv was a breach, or whether they believed cluster munitions that are banned by the UK and many other European nations but not Russia or the US had been used. On Monday, the UN general assembly began an emergency session to address the Russian invasion. Ukraine’s allies are hoping to get the support of more than 100 countries to support a resolution condemning Russia, in an attempt to press home Moscow’s isolation. While the assembly was underway, the US mission to the UN announced it was expelling 12 Russian diplomats for allegedly “engaging in espionage activities” which threatened national security. Russia’s ambassador to UN, Vassily Nebenzya, said the the diplomats had been told to leave by 7 March; He called it “another hostile” measure against the Russian mission. The Kremlin conceded on Monday that Russia’s economic reality had changed, but said there was no reason to doubt its central bank, which raised interest rates to 20% as it sought to shield the economy from tough new western sanctions. ‘The damage is done’: Russians face economic point of no returnRead more Panicked Russians withdrew savings and sought to exchange roubles for dollars and euros, while Russian businesses scrambled to protect their finances as the rouble lost nearly 30% of its value against the dollar on Monday. Measures adopted by the US, the UK, EU member states and other countries have blocked some Russian banks from the Swift international payments system and severely restricted the Russian central bank’s ability to access its $640bn (£477bn) of reserves. 01:50Zelenskiy says Russia continued to bomb Ukrainian cities during negotiation talks – video In a further crippling blow, the US on Monday imposed swingeing new sanctions, in effect blocking Americans from engaging in any transactions involving Russia’s central bank, finance ministry or national wealth fund. “The economic reality has considerably changed,” said the Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov. “These are heavy sanctions, they are problematic, but Russia has the potential to offset the harm. Russia has been making plans for quite a long time.” The EU has also shut all Russian planes out of its airspace, forcing the Russian airline Aeroflot to cancel all flights to European destinations until further notice. The Russian state media outlets RT and Sputnik have also been banned in the EU. Switzerland on Monday set aside its tradition of neutrality and said it would adopt all sanctions already imposed on Russia by the EU. “This is a big step for Switzerland,” said the country’s president, Ignazio Cassis. On Monday, Shell announced it would follow BP in divesting from its joint ventures in Russia, withdrawing from projects with the Russian gas corporation, Gazprom. In addition to sanctions, the US and several EU countries have announced they will send Stinger missiles and other military supplies to Ukraine. Germany has said it will increase defence spending massively, casting off decades of reluctance, while in a similarly radical change of policy Finland said it would send weapons and ammunition to Ukraine, the prime minister, Sanna Marin, said. For the first time in its history, the EU signed off on an agreement to finance the purchase and delivery of weapons to a country under attack, providing €500m (£420m) of military equipment to the Ukrainian armed forces in a move described as a “watershed moment”. Nato partners are also providing Ukraine with air-defence missiles and anti-tank weapons, the alliance’s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, tweeted on Monday. People wait in a queue outside a supermarket in central Kyiv, Ukraine. Photograph: Emilio Morenatti/AP Peskov doubled down on Monday on the Kremlin’s logic for sending Russian forces into Ukraine, saying western arms supplies showed that Moscow was right to try to demilitarise its neighbour and accusing the EU of hostile behaviour. Russia’s growing diplomatic isolation continued, with the UN human rights council agreeing on Monday to Ukraine’s request to hold an urgent debate on the invasion. Zelenskiy on Monday also formally signed an official request for Ukraine to join the EU. The bloc said it was is expecting Ukraine’s application “imminently”, which officials in Brussels said “would need to be assessed very rapidly by the council, and a decision made as to whether to request an urgent opinion from the Commission”. Western officials believe Putin wants to overthrow Ukraine’s government and replace it with a puppet regime. His instructions on Sunday for Russian nuclear readiness raised fears that the invasion could lead to nuclear war by design or mistake.

(AP Photo/Mindaugas Kulbis)","Monday, 28 February 2022",2022-02-28,Many predicted Nato expansion would lead to war. Those warnings were ignored,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/feb/28/nato-expansion-war-russia-ukraine,"Russia’s military offensive against Ukraine is an act of aggression that will make already worrisome tensions between Nato and Moscow even more dangerous. The west’s new cold war with Russia has turned hot. Vladimir Putin bears primary responsibility for this latest development, but Nato’s arrogant, tone‐​deaf policy toward Russia over the past quarter‐​century deserves a large share as well. Analysts committed to a US foreign policy of realism and restraint have warned for more than a quarter‐​century that continuing to expand the most powerful military alliance in history toward another major power would not end well. The war in Ukraine provides definitive confirmation that it did not. Thinking through the Ukraine crisis – the causes  “It would be extraordinarily difficult to expand Nato eastward without that action’s being viewed by Russia as unfriendly. Even the most modest schemes would bring the alliance to the borders of the old Soviet Union. Some of the more ambitious versions would have the alliance virtually surround the Russian Federation itself.” I wrote those words in 1994, in my book Beyond Nato: Staying Out of Europe’s Wars, at a time when expansion proposals merely constituted occasional speculation in foreign policy seminars in New York and Washington. I added that expansion “would constitute a needless provocation of Russia”. Why Vladimir Putin has already lost this war | Yuval Noah HarariRead more What was not publicly known at the time was that Bill Clinton’s administration had already made the fateful decision the previous year to push for including some former Warsaw Pact countries in Nato. The administration would soon propose inviting Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary to become members, and the US Senate approved adding those countries to the North Atlantic Treaty in 1998. It would be the first of several waves of membership expansion. Even that first stage provoked Russian opposition and anger. In her memoir, Madeleine Albright, Clinton’s secretary of state, concedes that “[Russian president Boris] Yeltsin and his countrymen were strongly opposed to enlargement, seeing it as a strategy for exploiting their vulnerability and moving Europe’s dividing line to the east, leaving them isolated.” Strobe Talbott, deputy secretary of state, similarly described the Russian attitude. “Many Russians see Nato as a vestige of the cold war, inherently directed against their country. They point out that they have disbanded the Warsaw Pact, their military alliance, and ask why the west should not do the same.” It was an excellent question, and neither the Clinton administration nor its successors provided even a remotely convincing answer. George Kennan, the intellectual father of America’s containment policy during the cold war, perceptively warned in a May 1998 New York Times interview about what the Senate’s ratification of Nato’s first round of expansion would set in motion. “I think it is the beginning of a new cold war,” Kennan stated. ”I think the Russians will gradually react quite adversely and it will affect their policies. I think it is a tragic mistake. There was no reason for this whatsoever. No one was threatening anybody else.” He was right, but US and Nato leaders proceeded with new rounds of expansion, including the provocative step of adding the three Baltic republics. Those countries not only had been part of the Soviet Union, but they had also been part of Russia’s empire during the Czarist era. That wave of expansion now had Nato perched on the border of the Russian Federation. Moscow’s patience with Nato’s ever more intrusive behavior was wearing thin. The last reasonably friendly warning from Russia that the alliance needed to back off came in March 2007, when Putin addressed the annual Munich security conference. “Nato has put its frontline forces on our borders,” Putin complained. Nato expansion “represents a serious provocation that reduces the level of mutual trust. And we have the right to ask: against whom is this expansion intended? And what happened to the assurances our western partners made after the dissolution of the Warsaw Pact?” In his memoir, Duty, Robert M Gates, who served as secretary of defense in the administrations of both George W Bush and Barack Obama, stated his belief that “the relationship with Russia had been badly mismanaged after [George HW] Bush left office in 1993”. Among other missteps, “US agreements with the Romanian and Bulgarian governments to rotate troops through bases in those countries was a needless provocation.” In an implicit rebuke to the younger Bush, Gates asserted that “trying to bring Georgia and Ukraine into Nato was truly overreaching”. That move, he contended, was a case of “recklessly ignoring what the Russians considered their own vital national interests”. The following year, the Kremlin demonstrated that its discontent with Nato’s continuing incursions into Russia’s security zone had moved beyond verbal objections. Moscow exploited a foolish provocation by Georgia’s pro‐​western government to launch a military offensive that brought Russian troops to the outskirts of the capital. Thereafter, Russia permanently detached two secessionist‐​minded Georgian regions and put them under effective Russian control. Western (especially US) leaders continued to blow through red warning light after a red warning light, however. The Obama administration’s shockingly arrogant meddling in Ukraine’s internal political affairs in 2013 and 2014 to help demonstrators overthrow Ukraine’s elected, pro‐​Russia president was the single most brazen provocation, and it caused tensions to spike. Moscow immediately responded by seizing and annexing Crimea, and a new cold war was underway with a vengeance. Could the Ukraine crisis have been avoided? Events during the past few months constituted the last chance to avoid a hot war in eastern Europe. Putin demanded that Nato provide guarantees on several security issues. Specifically, the Kremlin wanted binding assurances that the alliance would reduce the scope of its growing military presence in eastern Europe and would never offer membership to Ukraine. He backed up those demands with a massive military buildup on Ukraine’s borders. The Biden administration’s response to Russia’s quest for meaningful western concessions and security guarantees was tepid and evasive. Putin then clearly decided to escalate matters. Washington’s attempt to make Ukraine a Nato political and military pawn (even absent the country’s formal membership in the alliance) may end up costing the Ukrainian people dearly. The Ukraine tragedy History will show that Washington’s treatment of Russia in the decades following the demise of the Soviet Union was a policy blunder of epic proportions. It was entirely predictable that Nato expansion would ultimately lead to a tragic, perhaps violent, breach of relations with Moscow. Perceptive analysts warned of the likely consequences, but those warnings went unheeded. We are now paying the price for the US foreign policy establishment’s myopia and arrogance.

But the embassy says it is warning those people to “check Australian legislation”, after Scott Morrison also cautioned citizens against travelling to the conflict zone in Ukraine.  The Australian cabinet’s national security committee will discuss the latest developments when it meets on Tuesday, including the legal status of the new legion for international volunteers that Ukraine is assembling. Volodymyr Shalkivskyi, the chargé d’affaires at Ukraine’s embassy in Australia, said it had been contacted by “at least 20” people expressing an interest in travelling to the country to fight. “I am telling them that I don’t have any instructions yet,” Shalkivskyi told Guardian Australia. “I’m telling them they need to check Australian legislation because we don’t want for them to get into trouble.” Shalkivskyi said he expected numbers to be higher from countries in the immediate region. “In terms of Australia, it’s a very complicated story.” The caution about travelling into the conflict zone comes as the Australian government confirms it will send an initial $4m in funding for military assistance to Ukrainian forces, which will be used for nonlethal military equipment and medical supplies. A further sum for Nato’s Ukrainian trust fund is being finalised for “lethal aid”, which will go towards the supply of weapons to Ukrainian fighters, as well as potential support for cyber-attacks. On Sunday, Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said a new foreign legion for international volunteers was being assembled, with an appeal for anyone in the global community interested in fighting for democracy to join. Australia to provide ‘lethal aid’ to Ukraine as it fights invading Russian troopsRead more “This is the beginning of a war against Europe, against European structures, against democracy, against basic human rights, against a global order of law, rules and peaceful coexistence,” Zelenskiy said. “Anyone who wants to join the defence of Ukraine, Europe and the world can come and fight side by side with the Ukrainians against the Russian war criminals.” But Morrison said the government’s clear advice to all Australians was not to travel to Ukraine, and said the legalities of whether citizens could join Zelenskiy’s proposed foreign legion were “unclear”. “Our law sets out arrangements where people can be involved in official activity by a sovereign state, which Ukraine obviously qualifies for, but the nature of these arrangements are very uncertain,” Morrison said. Under the Criminal Code, it is an offence for an Australian to enter a foreign country with the intention of engaging in hostile activity, unless it is done as part of “the person’s service in any capacity in or with the armed forces of the government of a foreign country”. Morrison said his national security committee would “discuss these matters further tomorrow”, but he would “counsel against making assumptions about the legality of such activity at this point”. “I can understand absolutely the strong feelings and the motivations for people to go and do that, but I would say at this time the legality of such actions are uncertain under Australian law.” The treasurer Josh Frydenberg said that under Australian law, citizens could not go and fight in a conflict zone, “unless they’re fighting with a foreign government and a foreign army”. “Do not go into the conflict zone,” he told ABC radio. By contrast, the UK foreign secretary, Liz Truss, said on the weekend that British citizens who wanted to join the fight in Ukraine would “absolutely” have her support. The Australian foreign minister, Marise Payne, said it was “very important for individuals who may seek to do this to be clear of the provisions of Australian laws that may apply to their activity”. “Frankly, I would strongly encourage them to observe the travel advice, which is do not travel,” Payne told reporters in Sydney. Australia also updated its travel advice on Monday to urge Australians not to travel to Russia. Payne said this was “because of the deteriorating security environment and also the military conflict with Ukraine”. She noted there had been anti-war demonstrations and protests in Russia. “It is certainly in the interest of Australians who are in Russia to take this travel advice seriously and to to leave by commercial or private means as soon as they’re able to,” Payne said. On Monday, Morrison said details of the lethal aid package were being finalised with Nato, along with a package of humanitarian assistance. He said the humanitarian package would be “significant” and would assist Poland and other neighbouring countries manage the large number of refugees fleeing Ukraine. The United Nations estimates that at least 368,000 people have already fled their homes in Ukraine, with as many as 4.5 million to follow if the fighting continues to spread. Liz Truss criticised for backing Britons who wish to fight in UkraineRead more Waits of up to 70 hours have been reported at some of the nine border crossings into Poland, due to the sheer volume of people attempting to leave, and as Ukrainian officials attempt to stop men aged between 16 and 60 from leaving the country. Morrison also criticised the “reckless” threat from Russia to put its nuclear deterrence forces on high alert, and said the “swift” and “significant” response from the international community demonstrated that the invasion had “focused the minds of the world”. “I think the advance in Ukraine has not gone to quite the timetable or plan that I think Russia expected,” he said. Frydenberg said that Australia was concerned that the invasion into Ukraine was just the first step for president Vladimir Putin’s expansionist plans. “Vladimir Putin starts with Ukraine, but who’s next? That is the question,” he said. A raft of sanctions imposed by the Australian government came into effect at midnight on Sunday, including financial sanctions and travel bans on Putin and remaining permanent members of Russia’s security council: foreign minister Sergei Lavrov, defence minister Sergei Shoigu, prime minister Mikhail Mishustin and internal affairs minister Vladimir Kolokoltsev. “President Putin, foreign minister Lavrov and defence minister Shoigu are directly responsible for Russia’s unprovoked and unlawful further invasion of Ukraine,” the government said in a joint statement from Morrison, Frydenberg, Payne and defence minister Peter Dutton. “It is exceedingly rare to designate a head of state, and reflects the depth of our concerns.” Other leaders who have faced similar sanctions in the past include Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe, Muammar Gaddafi of Libya and Bashar al-Assad of Syria.",,,,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2adfae3259d573a3c3440b7866e91ac7c73c9d94/0_162_4928_2956/master/4928.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=e12cf2a3fcb413b2ce0f3e7694956118

A chance for Boris Johnson to look statesmanlike back home as he went on a day trip to Poland and Estonia. A quick in-out tour of eastern Europe where he got to rub shoulders with two prime ministers on the frontline and the secretary general of Nato. Nothing too tricky, nothing too newsy. Nothing that couldn’t just as easily have been done in a two-minute phone call. Diplomacy 101. Just a bog-standard show of solidarity as Ukraine endured its sixth day of Russian invasion.  And that’s the way it had looked to be panning out. The Suspect had arrived in Warsaw in the morning for talks with Mateusz Morawiecki, the Polish prime minister, in which the two men had done little more than reiterate their support of Ukraine and their condemnation of Russia. And the same had gone for Johnson’s mini speech in which he basically reiterated the same points. After all, what more could usefully be said without a huge strategic rethink from Nato countries? Boris may like to think of himself as a disruptor who makes things up as he goes along, but this is one crisis he has played strictly by the book. Then the choreography went awry. After Johnson had announced the UK would be taking at least twice as many refugees as the government had first promised – a move that was inevitable given the cross-party expressions of horror at the lack of compassion – came the press conference. And step forward Ukrainian journalist Daria Kaleniuk, the executive director of the Anti-Corruption Action Centre, whose two and a half minute intervention was less a question and more a howl of pain. People were dying, friends were terrified, she said. The reason Johnson was in Warsaw was because it was safe. There was no way he or any of his family would set foot in Kyiv but the people of Ukraine had no choice. They had been left to fight the Russians single-handedly while western leaders did little more than offer expressions of solidarity. As for sanctions, were they really working? Were any oligarchs or their children feeling the squeeze? So could Nato put its mind to protecting Ukrainian airspace with a no-fly zone? By the end, Kaleniuk was in tears. As were others in the room. It had been a moving and powerful reminder of the suffering taking place on our doorstep. Johnson was visibly disturbed by Kaleniuk. He squirmed and on occasions tried to avoid catching her eye. He did however make no effort to interrupt her or cut her short and – maybe it was the rawness of her pain that got to him – for once in his life gave her a straight answer. Normally the last thing he would ever think of doing. Much as he might have liked to have promised her more, he stuck to the script. The UK and the west could do little more than they were already doing without risking an all-out war with Russia. And that was something Nato just could not contemplate. If the price of that decision was Ukraine’s destruction, then so be it. Though he hoped it would not come to that. The Guardian view on Europe versus Putin: a strategic journey without maps | EditorialRead more There is a crack in everything. That’s how the light gets in. And in that exchange the limitations of the Nato response had been laid bare. Boris might have been enjoying the opportunity to do his Churchill tribute act on a world stage – at the very least it was a distraction from his troubles at home – but for all his muscular rhetoric, the expressions of solidarity and calling out of Putin’s war crimes, he was essentially operating with two arms tied behind his back. By the time that sanctions really hit, Kyiv could be rubble. The bottom line was that, stripped of his front and grandiosity, The Suspect is as much an onlooker to The Horror as the rest of us. If that was an all too brief moment of epiphany for Johnson – his denial and self-regard soon kicked back in – then Priti Patel would later have hers in the Commons. At least, she would have done if she wasn’t too dim to realise that she had been hopelessly exposed as a dangerously out of touch and inadequate home secretary. Because on Monday Priti Vacant had announced her new visa requirements for Ukrainian refugees and less than 24 hours later she was having to admit she had misjudged the mood of the country – it’s a problem when you’re naturally far more vicious than everyone else – and was now proposing a completely different, more open set of rules. Though this wasn’t quite how she put it. For Vacant, yesterday had been Phase 1 and today was Phase 2. It’s quite possible we’ll get Phase 3 tomorrow, when she remembers that most people also count their cousins as family. Though it’s equally possible that Patel would pride herself on keeping as many of her own family as possible out of the country. Especially if they were fleeing a war zone. “The Ukraine”, as she again insisted on calling it. So it was government policy to make itself look incompetent and out of touch by introducing a Phase 1 that even its own MPs couldn’t stomach. Understandably, Yvette Cooper, Labour’s shadow home secretary, was a little confused by the change of heart and tried to work out just who could and couldn’t come to the UK. It was way beyond Vacant’s intellectual pay grade to come up with any answers so she did what she always does when she feels challenged. She got stroppy and picked fights with whoever she could. She had a go at Cooper for not being supportive enough and then at the SNP for being a security risk who couldn’t be trusted with sensitive information. This from a minister who was sacked for moonlighting with her own foreign policy agenda. “The British government is the first government to outline practical measures for bringing Ukrainian refugees to the UK,” she said. To everyone’s surprise. It would be a turn up if the Poles had determined UK refugee policy. Though they couldn’t do any worse. It turned out that what Vacant had meant to say was that the UK had been the first to come up with a refugee policy. Which was just delusional. While opposition MPs tried to pin down the details, most Tories were just relieved their government had finally done more for refugees. Though not Edward Leigh. He wondered if we had done far too much already and thought his constituents had had enough of Ukraine. So sweet. Patel breathed a sigh of recognition. At last. She was back among her people once more.",/p/kqxmt,634.0,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/mar/01/boris-johnson-lets-a-sliver-of-cold-truth-cut-down-his-parade#comments,

Daria Kaleniuk, the executive director of the Anti-Corruption Action Centre, also pressed Johnson over the collective refusal of Nato countries to enforce a no-fly zone over Ukraine.  Kaleniuk told Johnson, who was giving a press conference in Warsaw on Tuesday after talks with his Polish counterpart, that she was from Kyiv and had passed across the border into Poland in recent days. “Ukrainian women and Ukrainian children are in deep fear because of bombs and missiles which are going from the sky. Ukrainian people are desperately asking for the rights to protect our sky, we are asking for a no-fly zone,” she said. “What’s the alternative for the no-fly zone? Nato is not willing to defend because Nato is afraid of world war three but it’s already started and it’s Ukrainian children who are there taking the hit. “You are talking about more sanctions, prime minister, but Roman Abramovich is not sanctioned, he’s in London, his children are not in the bombardments, his children are there in London.” Johnson responded: “I just want to say I am acutely conscious there is not enough we can do as the UK government to help in the way that you want. I’ve got to be honest about that. When you talk about the no-fly zone … unfortunately the implication of that is that the UK would be engaged in shooting down Russian planes, would be engaged in direct combat with Russia. That’s not something we can do.” He said the UK had been among the first to “tighten the economic noose” around Putin’s regime, and “Putin and Putin alone” was responsible for the suffering of the Ukrainian people. Abramovich, the Russian billionaire who recently passed stewardship of Chelsea FC to a charitable foundation, is said to have gone to Belarus to try to help negotiate peace. Chris Bryant, a Labour MP, told parliament last Thursday that Abramovich should have sanctions placed on him. Abramovich has vehemently disputed reports suggesting his alleged closeness to Vladimir Putin or that he has done anything to merit sanctions. Russian sanctions: who has been hit and who might be next?Read more Johnson is coming under mounting pressure over the UK’s slowness to bring in sanctions against oligarchs close to Putin, with the only asset freezes and travel bans so far brought in targeting Gennady Timchenko, Russia’s sixth richest oligarch, and Boris and Igor Rotenberg. Layla Moran, a Liberal Democrat MP, has listed in parliament 35 Russians who have been suggested by the imprisoned Russian dissident Alexei Navalny as possible targets for sanctions. Johnson on Tuesday acknowledged more could be done to tighten sanctions. “There is plainly more to be done on [the payments system] Swift, we can tighten up yet further on Swift, even though it has had a dramatic effect already, I think we do need to go further,” he said. “There’s more to be done on Sberbank, there’s more to be done on the freezing of Russian assets. I think there’s genuine amazement and dismay in Russia about what has happened already but there is more to be done.” There could be more “severing of sporting links” and “cracking down on the billionaires associated with Vladimir Putin,” he added. At a later press conference in Tapa, Estonia, Johnson pressed home the message that Nato is a “defensive alliance” and would not be placing troops into direct conflict with Russian soldiers. “I think for any Nato member to get involved actively in a conflict with Russia is a huge step which is not being actively contemplated by any member,” he said. “We will not fight Russian forces in Ukraine, and our reinforcements are firmly within the borders of Nato members and they are profoundly the right thing to do.” Speaking alongside him, the Estonian prime minister, Kaja Kallas, urged the west to upgrade support for the Baltic states, which she called “the most vulnerable part of Nato”. Nato’s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, responded by stressing the alliance’s determination to defend its member countries. “There must be no doubt, no room for miscalculation or misunderstanding. Our commitment to article 5 of the Washington treaty is iron-clad. We will protect and defend every inch of Nato territory.” ",,,,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1d87f2e3112c22658a951a6897d4d49f42c0fbdb/0_0_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=400de50403f3d81cbd5e4bdc9e84eebb

The Labour leader told his party’s MPs on Monday there was “no place” in the party for anyone drawing a “false equivalence” between the actions of Nato and those of Moscow.  Labour sources had suggested that if backbenchers made any comments at the Wednesday evening rally that were critical of Nato or sought to blame the western alliance for Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, it could lead to the whip being withdrawn. McDonnell, the former shadow chancellor, subsequently released a statement saying he would not attend the event at Conway Hall in London despite being listed as a speaker. “People are dying on the streets of Ukrainian cities. This is not the time to be distracted by political arguments here,” he told the website LabourList. “Nothing is more important at this time. Nothing should distract us from that. So I won’t feed into that distraction by going tonight.” Abbott, the former shadow home secretary, told the Guardian she would not be attending either. During the event, a man waving a Ukrainian flag interrupted the end of Jeremy Corbyn’s speech. The man was then forcibly removed from Conway Hall. Some leftwing Labour MPs believe Starmer is seeking a pretext to suspend them from the party, and are keen not to hand him any opportunity to do so. McDonnell said it was important for socialists to “stay on the pitch for as long as it takes”. McDonnell and Abbott were among 11 Labour backbenchers who yielded to pressure from the party’s chief whip last week and withdrew their names from a Stop the War motion urging Nato to “call a halt to its eastward expansion” and accusing the UK government of “sabre-rattling” over Ukraine. Starmer is keen to press home the shift in Labour’s approach to foreign affairs since he took over from Corbyn a year ago. He has offered staunch support to the government over Ukraine while pushing for tougher action on sanctions. The Labour leader used a Guardian article last month to attack Stop the War, in which Corbyn continues to play a prominent role, effectively accusing the group of siding with Russia. “At best they are naive, at worst they actively give succour to authoritarian leaders who directly threaten democracies. There is nothing progressive in showing solidarity with the aggressor,” Starmer wrote. A Labour spokesperson said: “Keir Starmer has set out the position of the Labour party and that is the position we expect every Labour MP to follow.” Asked whether Stop the War could be proscribed by the party, so that Labour members would effectively be banned from supporting it, he added: “That would be a matter for the national executive committee.” Andrew Murray, deputy president of Stop the War alongside Corbyn, condemned the approach, saying: “Keir Starmer’s authoritarian fear of Stop the War demeans him and the Labour party, not us. We have been proved right on Afghanistan, Iraq and Libya where Labour leaders were wrong. We are right in demanding de-escalation in Ukraine too, including immediate Russian troop withdrawal and a halt to Nato expansion.” Corbyn still has the whip suspended over his reaction to the Equality and Human Rights Commission’s critical report on Labour’s handling of antisemitism complaints under his leadership. He now sits as an independent and unless Starmer restores the whip will not be allowed to stand as a Labour candidate at the next general election.",,,,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e871e27ee7f40447d034c3834f211e38598f5084/0_190_5338_3204/master/5338.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=6becc09ee1b567b2a807017513fb929d
22,,,,"Wednesday, 2 March 2022",2022-03-02,Tory MP says Ben Wallace is defeatist in ruling out Ukraine no-fly zone,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/mar/02/uk-defence-secretary-ukraine-russia-no-fly-zone-ben-wallace,"A senior Conservative MP has accused the defence secretary, Ben Wallace, of being “misleading and defeatist” after he ruled out imposing a no-fly zone over Ukraine amid growing pleas from the invaded country. Tobias Ellwood, the chair of the defence select committee, said Britain and its Nato allies should have “more confidence in managing these cold war high-stakes scenarios” and urged Wallace and other ministers to “robustly contest” Russian airstrikes.  Ellwood is one of the few senior British politicians to advocate imposing a no-fly zone over Ukraine, which was called for last week by the country’s ambassador to the UK. Wallace said on Wednesday that it risked starting a general war with Russia. Enforcing a no-fly zone would require “British fighter jets shooting down Russian fighter jets”, Wallace said, and if a British or other Nato jet was lost it “would lead to a war against Russia, across the whole of Europe”, with Nato’s members being obliged to join the conflict. “That is not a position that members of Nato are prepared to go,” he told Sky News. What more could the west do about Russia’s invasion of Ukraine?Read more Reacting to those remarks, Ellwood said: “It is misleading, simplistic and indeed defeatist to suggest engaging in a no-fly zone over Ukraine would automatically lead to a war, even nuclear conflict with Russia” – although he said he recognised the potential for military escalation was real. He argued it should be possible to face down Russia in the air over Ukraine without starting a wider war. “We should have more confidence in ourselves managing these cold war high-stakes scenarios rather than hesitating only to face up to a bigger battle in the future.” Russian bombing continued in Ukraine on Wednesday, with US officials warning that Vladimir Putin’s regime had stepped up missile and artillery attacks, although so far Moscow’s use of airstrikes and air power in the week-old war has been surprisingly limited. Some of Ukraine’s air force, which was widely expected to be swiftly knocked out, remains airborne, with Kyiv claiming on Wednesday that two of its MiG-29 fighters knocked out two Russian Su-35s, for the loss of one of the MiGs. Most independent commentators agree a no-fly zone is too risky now that Russia has declared war. But Keir Giles, a fellow at Chatham House, said he believed the opportunity had been missed and a no-fly zone could have implemented before the invasion, “possibly even preventing it” because Nato forces would have been “arriving in peaceful skies to keep Russia out”. He added: “Now you would have to fight your way in.” Wallace also said a no-fly zone would stop Ukrainian pilots being able to target Russia from the air, giving an advantage to Moscow, which has stronger ground troops and tanks. “If you had a no-fly zone in Ukraine, the overwhelming scale of the Russian army would be able to drive around with impunity, which it can’t at the moment,” he said. 01:17Kharkiv administrative buildings on fire after Russian missile strike – video Wallace said a convoy of Russian tanks heading towards Kyiv was moving so slowly because of logistical problems and low morale. However, he said the faltering progress of troops could lead to more aerial bombardment from Russia, and there was a risk that of Putin’s “brutality increasing” as his efforts were stalling. “The Russians are considerably behind their schedule, by days not hours, and that leads to stresses on their logistical supply chains,” he told the BBC. “That’s why you have seen some of these columns fairly grind to a halt. They have also been surprised by the strength of the Ukrainian resistance.” Wallace said Russia would face “years of resistance” if it sought to occupy Ukraine.

The striking design on the Guardian Weekly’s cover this week is by Sergiy Maidukov, a Kyiv-based illustrator. His depiction of plumes of smoke rising from a Ukrainian horizon was one of several images he created on his iPad while under curfew in the city.  “We are sharing an apartment with four friends and doing some volunteering – delivering food and stuff,” Maidukov wrote on Monday. “I live now at the swing of extreme feelings, from dark fear to bright optimism. In days like these, it is impossible to be on one’s own.” He and his friends have also been donating blood. But, amid the bleak scenes, he also feels hope for the future: “I feel that this time, historically, we have the best chances ever to fight Russia back. We are already discussing how we should rebuild our country after the victory. Glory to Ukraine!” Our special edition of the magazine this week contains 16 pages of dedicated news coverage, kicking off with Russian author Vladimir Sorokin’s scathing essay on the rot at the heart of Moscow’s power pyramid that has created a monster. Shaun Walker, Emma Graham-Harrison and Peter Beaumont lead our coverage on the ground in Ukraine, while there’s brilliant analysis and context from the rest of the Guardian and Observer’s international reporting team, including Timothy Garton Ash and Daniel Boffey. Then, on the Opinion pages, with hundreds of thousands now fleeing Ukraine and the west facing up to a new existential threat, Jonathan Freedland offers the stark reminder that while Putin’s appalling worldview took full shape, it was our leaders who wilfully looked the other way. The nomination of Ketanji Brown Jackson to the US supreme court last week may understandably have passed below many people’s radar. Lauren Gambino explains why Jackson’s rise is a timely boost for Joe Biden, while in Opinion Moira Donegan argues that the president’s groundbreaking choice was born to the role.

Fright, despair and bewilderment are etched on every face that appears on TV or in the papers. Adults should be ashamed of what we are doing to these innocents all over the world. Malik is right. We are appalled by what is happening in Ukraine, yet appear to ignore or be indifferent to other conflicts. Millions of children are frightened and starving to death in Afghanistan because of sanctions imposed upon a new government. Millions are frightened and starving in Yemen, where western arms support allows Saudi Arabia to cripple food supplies. Children in Syria are frightened and hungry as the civil war drags on. Iraq is failing and the children suffer. In Africa, starvation and fear permeate the continent in places such as Nigeria, Ethiopia, Somalia and Sudan. And everywhere the faces of children are a fierce and damning testimony to adult behaviour.Michael NewmanShefford, Bedfordshire  Nesrine Malik writes that the bloody Russian invasion of Ukraine should open our eyes to other more distant wars, but she does not mention that some of those wars have been started by our own governments in the west. The invasion and occupation of Iraq (“shock and awe”, as they boasted) reportedly led to up to 1 million deaths, as well as the birth of Islamic State; the invasion of Libya, which was supported by Nato, has caused turmoil and misery in the region. The long-term effects of the invasion and occupation of Afghanistan, which Nato also supported, are now clear to see. Food for thought.Brigid KeenanBatcombe, Somerset Nesrine Malik’s article on an accepted view in the “west” that wars only happen to poor and uncivilised people partly explains why there is such a lack of coverage of the war in Yemen, which the UK government is supporting in supplying arms to Saudi Arabia. Where is the outrage at the humanitarian catastrophe that is happening there? Recent sanctions imposed by the US are going to further cripple efforts to deliver humanitarian aid to areas of Yemen under the Houthis’ control. The Yemeni people are dying without shelter and food.Rae StreetLittleborough, Greater Manchester As Nesrine Malik notes, there are wars elsewhere than in Ukraine. An elderly Christian lady I met recently said with some bitterness that she would not be responding to the various calls for prayers for Ukraine. Why? Despite years of conflict and thousands of deaths in her country, she has never heard British church leaders pray for peace there. She is a Nigerian refugee and had clearly got the message – if it is only black people massacring each other a safe distance away, let them get on with it.Rev Richard BradshawSowerby, North Yorkshire Moustafa Bayoumi’s timely article on the unconscious racism all too evident in some coverage of the war in Ukraine makes uncomfortable reading (They are ‘civilised’ and ‘look like us’: the racist coverage of Ukraine, 2 March), but let us not forget that for more than 100 years, Europe has been scarred by wars on a scale previously unimaginable in which racial hatred played a large part. Though often overlooked, this undeniable aspect is emphasised by the title of Mark Mazower’s fine book, Dark Continent: Europe’s Twentieth Century (1998), in which it is traced from the end of the first world war to the wars following on from the breakup of Yugoslavia in the 1990s.Emeritus professor James Alan DownieGoldsmiths, University of London Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

In the overheated atmosphere today we are accused of apologising for Putin’s brutal invasion and of being “fifth columnists” and “traitors”. In 2003 we were “friends of the Taliban” or “allies of Saddam”. It wasn’t true then and it’s not true now. What is true is that there seems to be a permanent glitch in the matrix of the minds of war enthusiasts that prevents them from understanding that it is possible to oppose the policy of your own government and still oppose the actions of other governments. Our critics want to make it either/or. But it’s not. Unlike many of our detractors, we are consistent in opposing the misery, death, displacement and disruption that affects any country consumed by war.  We feel horror and sickness when we see Putin’s invasion, his attacks on civilian populations and the shelling of a nuclear power station. We have welcomed, supported and publicised the actions of anti-war protesters in Russia. We wish our critics were as consistent, but we wait without expectation for the praise showered on anti-war protesters to come our way. We want to welcome the refugees queueing at the Polish borders and think that our government should do much more to let them into one of the richest countries in the world. And again we hope our critics will be as welcoming to refugees fleeing western wars in Iraq, Afghanistan, Yemen and Libya. The hypocrisies of the war supporters are only possible if we forget the context and history of modern wars. Ukraine did not come out of a clear blue sky. We cannot accept a narrative that ignores context and history and simply puts this invasion down to Putin’s designation as the latest “new Hitler” or to his mental state. To wilfully ignore the past, including the recent past, is a disservice to all those who want to end this war. The roots of this conflict lie in what has happened since the end of the cold war and the collapse of the Soviet Union. The Warsaw Pact was dissolved, whereas its western opposite, Nato, was not. Despite assurances to the contrary, Nato expanded ever closer towards the Russian border, incorporating 14 new member states, mainly in eastern Europe. It has also expanded into “out of area operations”, including central involvement in Afghanistan and Libya. It now plans further expansion into the Indo-Pacific as part of an increased military presence against China. It is not repeating Kremlin propaganda to point out these facts. And the anti-war movement is far from alone in doing this. George Kennan, the doyen of US foreign policy, has said the same. So did William Burns in 2008. He is now head of the CIA. This is not the first war in Europe since 1945. That was in the former Yugoslavia in the 1990s, culminating with the Nato bombing of Serbia in 1999. This marked a key turning point in relations with Russia. The next Nato operation was Afghanistan in 2001, initially supported by Russia, as was the bombing of Libya in 2011. These, plus the war in Iraq in 2003, have shaped the present. The features now so widely and correctly condemned in Russia’s invasion of Ukraine – from cluster bombs to targeting of civilians to besieging cities – have all been part of western wars, but with very little comment or opposition from the British political class. There was no referral to the international criminal court for the US following its use of depleted uranium in the Iraqi city of Falluja; no sanctions when Trump ordered the dropping the “mother of all bombs” on Afghanistan; no outcry at Britain’s continuing support for Saudi Arabia’s brutal bombing of Yemen. The anti-war movement has a better record of consistency in opposing wars than those who applaud and justify our own government’s wars while decrying the same behaviour by Putin. If the first casualty of war is truth, then the second must be the increasingly intolerant, repressive and anti-Russian sentiments across sections of British society. Keir Starmer’s threat to remove the whip from 11 MPs if they criticised Nato is an astonishing piece of thought policing, and something that even Tony Blair never attempted to do over Afghanistan or Iraq. Are we seriously saying that there can be no criticism of our government’s foreign policy or of its dreadful record of wars over the past 20 years, culminating in the defeat last year in Afghanistan? History demands the west deploy every legal and financial weapon against Putin | Mikhail KhodorkovskyRead more In some ways even more chilling are the reports of Russian films being removed from festivals, of Russian cats being banned from shows, and of the proposed removal of the statue in Manchester of Friedrich Engels (a German), who always opposed Russia as a Tsarist autocracy and whose political beliefs are roundly denounced by Putin. Talk of no-fly zones has so far been rejected, but we should be aware that any such move would be a declaration of war on Russia by Nato, with terrible consequences. I have no problem with condemning imperialism of any sort. I regard Russia as an imperialist power, although considerably lesser economically and militarily than its opponents. The system of imperialism leads to economic rivalry, which turns into military competition. We have seen a huge increase in military spending throughout the world in the past decades. This war is leading to calls for even more: Germany announced this week it will double its spending, and there is a growing militarisation across Europe.

Linda Thomas-Greenfield, speaking at an emergency meeting of the UN security council in New York on Friday, the US envoy said Russia’s actions, which caused a major fire at the Zaporizhzhia compound, reflected a “dangerous new escalation” in its invasion of Ukraine. “Russia’s attack last night put Europe’s largest nuclear power plant at grave risk,” she said. “It was incredibly reckless and dangerous. And it threatened the safety of civilians across Russia, Ukraine and Europe.”  Meanwhile, Ukraine’s president issued a rebuke to Nato which earlier refused to impose a no-fly zone, over concerns that doing so could cause the war to escalate across Europe. In a furious late night speech, Volodymyr Zelenskiy said: “All the people who die from this day forward will also die because of you, because of your weakness, because of your lack of unity. “The alliance has given the green light to the bombing of Ukrainian cities and villages by refusing to create a no-fly zone.” At a meeting of Nato foreign ministers in Brussels, the alliance’s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg said the alliance could not directly engage with Russian forces. “The only way to implement a no-fly zone is to send Nato fighter planes into Ukraine’s airspace, and then impose that no-fly zone by shooting down Russian planes,” Stoltenberg said. ‘Ninety per cent of houses are damaged’: thousands trapped in Ukraine’s small townsRead more Western leaders expressed outrage at the incident at Zaporizhzhia, with the British prime minister, Boris Johnson, describing Putin’s actions as “now directly threatening the safety of all of Europe” and the US president, Joe Biden, condemning Moscow for the shelling, which Russia claimed was a “monstrous provocation” by Ukrainian saboteurs. The US embassy in Kyiv called the attack a “war crime” in a post on Twitter but the US state department reportedly distanced itself from the allegation, instructing its other embassies not to retweet the claim. The fire, at a training centre on the site’s perimeter, was extinguished on Friday and officials said radiation was normal. The head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Rafael Grossi, said the reactors were undamaged but the situation “naturally continues to be extremely tense and challenging”. Russian forces seized the plant after heavy fighting. Russian ground forces in the south of Ukraine made an assault on the shipbuilding centre of Mykolaiv as they began their long-expected push west towards the key port of Odesa.

The BBC announced it was suspending all operations in the country and the Russian newspaper Novaya Gazeta, edited by the Nobel peace prize winner Dmitry Muratov, said it would be removing content on Ukraine. Access to Facebook and Twitter was also completely blocked in retaliation for the social media platforms’ restrictions on state-backed media. At the Nato foreign ministers’s meeting Stoltenberg, described the Russian invasion of Ukraine as “the worst military aggression in Europe for decades … with cities under siege, schools, hospitals, and residential buildings shelled”. In a sobering assessment of the military situation, he told reporters there was evidence of the use of cluster bombs and “other types of weapons which would be in violation of international law”, adding: “The days to come are likely to be worse.” He warned that there was also a growing risk of the war spreading to Georgia, on whose territory Vladimir Putin’s troops are already present, and Bosnia-Herzegovina, where Bosnian Serbs have been threatening to break up the state with the Kremlin’s support. The UN human rights office said it had confirmed 331 civilians, including 19 children, had been killed and 675 injured since the invasion began on 24 February, adding that the real toll would be much higher. Most were killed by explosive weapons such as shelling from heavy artillery, multi-launch rocket systems, missiles and airstrikes. Map of Russian offensive The UN refugee and children’s agencies said more than 1.2 million people had fled the country, including about half of a million children. The UNCHR spokesperson Joung-ah Ghedini-Williams described the rate as “phenomenal”, adding that an equal number were probably displaced inside Ukraine. Ursula von der Leyen, the European Commission president, said the EU was working with NGOs in Ukraine to establish “humanitarian corridors”, after agreement between Kyiv and representatives from the Kremlin on Thursday. “Humanitarian aid must be able to reach all parts of Ukraine and civilians must be allowed to escape cities under siege,” she said. The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, said in Brussels that the west was “faced with what is President Putin’s war of choice: unprovoked, unjustified, and a war that is having horrific, horrific consequences for real people. For mothers, fathers. For children. We see the images on TV, and it has to stop.” Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, who had joined the meeting in Brussels by video link, showed Blinken and EU foreign ministers photographs of the carnage being wrought. “One of which I think has also been in the media shows a father grieving over his dead child,” Blinken said. “Blood is still on the sheet, the drapes, it’s a reminder that even as we talk about these weighty issues of war and peace, what this is really about is the lives of men, women, children, hundreds, thousands of individual human tragedies inflicted by Vladimir Putin and his war of choice on Ukraine and its people and we can’t lose sight of that fact.” Putin, however, dismissed reports of airstrikes on Kyiv and other large Ukrainian cities as “gross propaganda fakes” in a phone call with the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, the Kremlin said. The Russian president “confirmed Russia is open to dialogue” with Ukraine but only “on condition all Russian demands are met”, it said. Those demands included neutral and non-nuclear status for Ukraine and its “denazification”, the recognition of Crimea as part of Russia and of the “sovereignty” of separatist territories in eastern Ukraine, Moscow said. Putin told Scholz he hoped “Kyiv will take a reasonable and constructive position” in a third round of talks planned for next week, the Kremlin statement added. Putin separately warned Russia’s neighbours on Friday “not to escalate the situation” by imposing more restrictions on his country. As Russian forces stepped up their assault on cities particularly in the south and east of Ukraine, the country’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said his country had “survived a night that could have stopped the story, the history of Ukraine, the history of Europe”. A day after Moscow’s forces took control of the strategically important city of Kherson, the invading troops continued to besiege population centres, particularly in southern Ukraine, pounding them with artillery and airstrikes and causing devastating damage. The governor of Mykolaiv said Russian troops had entered his city of about 500,000 people, although a presidential adviser later said the advance had been halted. The south-eastern port city of Mariupol is also encircled by Russian forces and heavily bombarded, but remains under Ukrainian control. The city’s deputy mayor, Sergei Orlov, said its humanitarian situation was “terrible” after 40 hours of continuous shelling including on schools and hospitals. “I believe that he wants to destroy Ukraine as a nation, and Mariupol is on this way.”",,,,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/30e8a649997d1300e47574da00671e0171abbb78/0_100_5407_3245/master/5407.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=68df69e634f6210aabe7c40ab78b0f33

Indeed, if the Russians are ever to withdraw, a diplomatic agreement on the terms of withdrawal will be necessary. The first round of Ukrainian-Russian talks has now taken place in Belarus, and a member of the Ukrainian delegation has stated that “The parties identified a number of priority topics in which certain solutions were outlined”.  The West should back a peace agreement and Russian withdrawal by offering Russia the lifting of all new sanctions imposed on it. The offer to Ukraine should be a massive reconstruction package that will also help Ukraine to move towards the West economically and politically rather than militarily – just as Finland and Austria were able to do during the Cold War despite their neutral status. The demands by the Russian side are that Ukraine should sign a treaty of neutrality; engage in “demilitarisation” and “denazification”; and recognise Russian sovereignty over Crimea, which was seized back by Russia after the Ukrainian Revolution. These demands are a mixed bag of the acceptable, the unacceptable, and the undefined. Sanctions and boycotts: how the west has responded to the invasion of UkraineRead more The option of neutrality for Ukraine has often been called “Finlandisation”, and perhaps the determined and unified Ukrainian response to Russian aggression over the past week has given a new meaning to that term in the case of Ukraine. For like the Finns in the “winter war” of 1939-40, the Ukrainians have also been abandoned militarily by the West, which has declared publicly and repeatedly that it has no intention of fighting to defend them. On the other hand, it seems that the extraordinary courage and resolution with which the Finns fought convinced Stalin that to rule Finland would be too much of a challenge. Finland became the only part of the former Russian Empire not to be incorporated in the USSR, and during the cold war, though neutral by treaty, was able to develop as a successful social market democracy. Similarly, we must hope that the courage and determination of the Ukrainians has convinced Putin that it will be impossible to run Ukraine as a Russian client state, and neutrality is the best deal he is going to get. President Volodymyr Zelensky has publicly hinted that a treaty of neutrality may be on offer; and he is right to do so. For two things have been made absolutely clear by this war: that Russia will fight to prevent Ukraine becoming a military ally of the West, and the West will not fight to defend Ukraine. In view of this, to keep open the possibility of an offer of Nato membership that Nato has no intention of ever honouring, and asking Ukrainians to die for this fiction, is worse than hypocritical. As to “demilitarisation” and “denazification”, the meaning and terms of these will have to be negotiated. Demilitarisation is obviously unacceptable if it means that Ukraine must unilaterally dissolve its armed forces; but the latest statement by Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov has suggested that Russia would accept a ban on missiles based in Ukraine. This could be modelled on a similar guarantee to the US that ended the Cuba Missile Crisis. As for “Denazification”, this presumably means that Ukraine should ban extreme right wing nationalist parties and militias at Russia’s behest. This is a completely unacceptable interference in Ukraine’s internal affairs; but perhaps Ukraine could make a counter-offer that would meet Moscow’s concerns about the rights and future of the Russian minority in Ukraine by guaranteeing these under the Ukrainian constitution – which, by the way, is something that the West should support anyway, in accordance with its own principles. There remains the demand for recognition of the Russian annexation of Crimea. Here, respect for international law (slightly ambiguous in the case of Crimea, which was only transferred from Russia to Ukraine by Soviet decree in 1954) must be tempered by considerations of reality, the prevention of future conflict, and the interests of ordinary people in the region – which is essentially what we have been asking Russia to do in the case of Kosovo. Ukraine has already lost Crimea, and cannot recover it, as Serbia cannot recover Kosovo, without a bloody and unending war that in this case Ukraine would almost certainly lose. Our principle in all such disputes must be that the fate of the territories concerned must be decided by local democratic referenda under international supervision. This should also apply to the Donbas separatist republics. These proposals will be denounced as “rewarding Russian aggression”; but if Putin’s original aim really was to subjugate the whole of Ukraine, then by such an agreement Moscow would fall far short of its maximal goals. Moreover, such an agreement would give Russia nothing that it had not in practice already achieved before launching the invasion. The West is morally right to oppose the monstrous and illegal Russian war and to have imposed exceptionally severe sanctions on Russia in response, but would be morally wrong to oppose a reasonable agreement to end the invasion and spare the people of Ukraine terrible suffering. America’s own record over the past generation gives no basis for such self-righteous hyper-legalism.

Thank you for reading.Russia-Ukraine war latest news: world leaders urge ceasefire after shelling starts fire at nuclear power plant – liveRead moreUpdated at 07.39 GMT 4 Mar 202205.27SummaryIt is 7.27am in Ukraine as Russia’s war on its neighbour enters its ninth day. Here is where the crisis stands:
A fire broke out in a training building outside a nuclear power plant in Zaporizhzhia in the early hours of Friday, after being shelled by Russian forces, Ukrainian authorities said. An employee at the plant said Russian forces had fired on the facility and there was “a real threat of nuclear danger at the largest nuclear power plant in Europe”.
After burning for at least four hours amid reports Russian troops had prevented emergency teams from attending to the blaze, Ukrainian emergency services confirmed the blaze was extinguished at 6.20am local time. Fighting at the plant has also reportedly stopped, according to the mayor of Enerhodar, a town located south-east of the plant.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) earlier said it had put its Incident and Emergency Centre in “full 24/7 response mode” due to the “serious situation” unfolding at Zaporizhzhia.
However, US Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm provided reassurance surrounding the Zaporizhzhia power plant reactors, saying there was no elevated radiation readings near the facility and the plant’s reactors are “protected by robust containment structures and reactors are being safely shut down.”
Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy made another appeal to Europe for help following the attack on the nuclear plant. He said: We warn everyone that not a single nation ever shelled nuclear power stations. For the first time in the history of humankind, the terrorist state commits nuclear terrorism.
British prime minister Boris Johnson called Russian president Vladimir Putin’s “reckless actions” a danger to the safety of Europe.
Russian forces continue to control both local and regional government buildings in the strategically important Black Sea port of Kherson, local authorities said. Russian forces appeared to be moving to cut Ukraine off from the sea via its key southern ports, claiming the capture of Kherson and tightening the siege of Mariupol.
Concern is mounting over the movements of a huge column of Russian military vehicles outside Kyiv. While a US defence official suggested it appeared to have “stalled”, there was also speculation that an estimated 15,000 troops attached to it may be regrouping and waiting for logistical supplies before an assault on Kyiv.
In a televised speech shortly after his 90-minute call with Macron, Putin claimed Russian military operations in Ukraine were going according to plan. The president went on to accuse Ukrainian forces of using civilians as “human shields” while providing no evidence. 4 Mar 202204.45Fire at Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant extinguished, officials sayUkrainian emergency services have confirmed a fire in the training building of the Zaporizhzhya nuclear plant has been extinguished after a blaze burned for at least four hours throughout early Friday morning.No casualties have so far been reported.

Photograph: Vadim Ghirdă/AP,Ukrainian soldiers help families fleeing the town of Irpin on Saturday,"Saturday, 5 March 2022",2022-03-05,Defiant Putin warns the west: your sanctions are akin to an act of war,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/05/defiant-putin-warns-the-west-your-sanctions-are-akin-to-an-act-of-war,"Vladimir Putin delivered a chilling warning to the west over the imposition of sanctions on Russia on Saturday, warning that measures designed to cripple his country’s economy were “akin to an act of war”. In comments that were both defiant and threatening, the Russian president also told Ukraine’s leaders that their nation risked being dismantled as an independent sovereign state if they continued to resist Russia’s invasion.  “The current leadership needs to understand that if they continue doing what they are doing, they risk the future of Ukrainian statehood,” Putin said. “If that happens they will have to be blamed for that.” His intervention, in which he hinted the conflict could soon spread beyond Ukraine unless the west changed course, came as Moscow broke a ceasefire agreement to allow Ukrainian civilians to flee after 10 days of bombing and devastation. Later, Russia’s foreign ministry followed up Putin’s warning by specifically singling out the UK for what it called “sanctions hysteria” and its prominent role in supporting Ukraine. Maria Zakharova, the foreign ministry spokeswoman, said Russia would not forget the UK’s cooperation with Kyiv. “The sanctions hysteria in which London plays one of the leading, if not the main, roles, leaves us no choice but to take proportionately tough retaliatory measures,” she said, adding that Britain’s Russian interests would be “undermined” by Moscow’s response. As tensions rose to new levels, and early hopes that diplomatic progress might be made in behind-the-scenes negotiations were dashed, the UK Foreign Office advised all Britons in Russia to leave without delay by any available commercial routes. The number of UK citizens in the country is estimated at upwards of 6,000. Increasingly, European diplomats believe Putin sees the west’s supply of weaponry and other support to Ukraine as direct intervention of a kind that requires retaliation. Referring to Ukraine’s demand for Nato to impose a no-fly zone over the country – which Nato has rejected – Putin added: “The realisation of that demand would bring catastrophic results not only to Europe but to the whole world.” Kyiv calls on NATO to close the sky over Ukraine. Photograph: Sergey Dolzhenko/EPA Last night, Boris Johnson appeared undeterred by the escalation of Russia’s rhetoric, with the prime minister announcing a six-point plan “to ensure Putin fails” that includes supporting Ukraine in defending itself, and “maximising the economic pressure on Putin’s regime”. Johnson said: “It is not enough to express our support for the rules-based international order – we must defend it against a sustained attempt to rewrite the rules by military force.” On the ground, Ukraine claimed on Saturday to have destroyed more of Russia’s firepower. The armed forces said soldiers had shot down a helicopter and two warplanes, capturing three pilots. One of them had taken part in Russian bombing missions in Syria, it alleged. Ukrainian troops launched a successful counter-attack in the Kharkiv region, seizing equipment and armoured vehicles. The city, Ukraine’s second biggest, has been under ferocious Russian bombardment. 01:38Gunfire reportedly heard as Ukrainians rally in Kherson against Russia's occupation – video On Saturday, in the south of the country residents flooded the main square in the city of Kherson and protested peacefully against the occupation. They waved Ukrainian flags and even hijacked a Russian armoured personnel carrier, taking it for a spin, to loud applause. Similar large-scale anti-Russian demonstrations took place in Melitopol, where Russian soldiers fired into the air, and the Azov Sea port of Berdyansk. As the ceasefire agreements broke down, both sides blamed each other. The Kremlin blamed Ukraine for the collapse of a deal to evacuate civilians from the besieged city of Mariupol and the nearby town of Volnovakha, while Ukrainian officials said attempts to create a humanitarian corridor in the east for 200,000 trapped civilians failed because of shelling. Despite the growing international alarm and the escalation of rhetoric, diplomatic efforts were underway this weekend to broker a way out of the crisis. It is understood President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan of Turkey, which has so far refused to impose sanctions on Moscow, is hoping to speak to Putin on Sunday to discuss a ceasefire. Diplomats believe Erdoğan is eyeing a potential role as interlocutor. Meanwhile EU leaders will meet in Versailles in Paris on Thursday to try to come to a common position on Ukraine’s request for candidate status. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, is believed to see putting his country on a “fast track” to joining the EU as crucial to securing its political future, even if Kyiv needs to offer Putin a guarantee of military neutrality in any talks on ending the war. In Washington, there has been talk of offering Putin a so-called “golden bridge” – blocking all his avenues of advance while making retreat as attractive as possible. US secretary of state Antony Blinken said on Friday the door to negotiation was open. “If they show any signs of being willing to engage in meaningful diplomacy, of course we’ll engage,” he said. 04:41 'I can't believe this is happening': the refugees trying to escape Ukraine – video But western diplomats do not believe Putin is in the mood to backdown or negotiate. Former UK foreign secretary Malcolm Rifkind said, however, that Putin must have been stung by the huge effects of the sanctions, particularly the blocking of 60% of Russia’s $600bn of foreign reserves. US officials hope the economic pain inflicted on Russia will force Putin to climb down. But some critics of the Biden administration’s response argue the “golden bridge” has not been signposted clearly enough. “If the goal is to compel, then the sanctioners need to be explicit about what Russia can do to get the sanctions lifted,” Dan Drezner, a political scientist and sanctions expert at Tufts University, wrote in the Washington Post. “That lack of clarity undermines coercive bargaining, because the targeted actor believes sanctions will stay in place no matter what they do.”",,,,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a46ea9b415630d55708fbed1de862c4d2e4e25aa/0_75_6001_3601/master/6001.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=82553bf0950d2b4ab83549def21791e8

In a statement, the city council asked residents to return to shelters in the city and await further information on evacuation.  In a televised broadcast, Ukrainian presidential adviser Oleksiy Arestovych said Russia was not observing an agreed ceasefire in some areas, preventing a joint plan to allow civilians to evacuate. Meanwhile, Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, accused the Nato alliance of bending to Russian pressure and said it was not the force that Ukrainians had previously imagined. Speaking on Ukrainian television, he said he was open to talks with his Russian counterpart, Sergei Lavrov, but only if they were “meaningful”. The Russian defence ministry said its units had opened humanitarian corridors near Mariupol and Volnovakha, a smaller city 40 miles (65km) to the north, on Saturday morning. Evacuations from Mariupol had been due to begin at 11am local time (0900 GMT). 01:13Footage shows devastated town of Volnovakha, Ukraine – video Located on the Sea of Azov, the city of 450,000 people has become the scene of growing misery amid days of shelling that has knocked out power and most phone service and raised the prospect of food and water shortages for hundreds of thousands of people in freezing weather. The city represents a potential strategic advantage for Moscow’s invasion, connecting it to the Russian forces coming from annexed Crimea, as well as to the troops in the Donbas. In Volnovakha, the attack is still so intense that dead bodies lie uncollected, those hiding in shelters are running out of food, and about 90% of the city has been damaged by bombing, local MP Dmytro Lubinets said. Before the postponement, the Ukrainian government said the plan was to evacuate about 200,000 people from Mariupol and 15,000 from Volnovakha, and that the Red Cross would act as the ceasefire’s guarantor. An adviser to Ukraine’s interior ministry said there would be agreements on humanitarian corridors for other cities. Turkey said the humanitarian ceasefires declared by Russia should be countrywide and lasting. The Turkish foreign minister, Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu, said evacuation and aid shipment corridors must be opened across the country and that it was working to evacuate its citizens in Ukraine by bus and train. The Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, was due to speak to Vladimir Putin by phone on Sunday. A spokesperson said Turkey was ready to help resolve the crisis. Putin said on Saturday that western sanctions on Russia were akin to a declaration of war and warned that any attempt to impose a no-fly zone in Ukraine would lead to catastrophic consequences for the world. Map: progress of war in Ukraine Putin reiterated that his aims were to defend Russian-speaking communities through the “demilitarisation and de-nazification” of the country so that Russia’s former Soviet neighbour becomes neutral and no longer threatens Russia. Ukraine and western countries have dismissed this as a baseless pretext for the invasion he launched on 24 February and imposed a sweeping range of sanctions aimed at isolating Moscow. “These sanctions that are being imposed are akin to a declaration of war, but thank God it has not come to that,” Putin said, speaking to a group of flight attendants at an Aeroflot training centre near Moscow. Mariupol and Volnovakha are just two of many cities across Ukraine left reeling by a devastating campaign of shelling and artillery from Russian forces. The Russian defence ministry said on Saturday a broad offensive would continue elsewhere in Ukraine. Ukraine said Russian forces were trying to encircle the capital, Kyiv, and Kharkiv, the country’s second biggest city, while attempting to set up a land bridge to Crimea. Authorities in Sumy, about 190 miles east of Kyiv, reportedly urged residents to stay inside shelters, warning there could be fighting in the city’s streets. Russian forces have taken control of a psychiatric hospital in the town of Borodyanka in Ukraine’s Kyiv region, with 670 people inside, the regional governor Oleksiy Kuleba told local media on Saturday. “Today we do not understand how to evacuate these people, how to help them,” Kuleba said. “They are running out of water and medicines,” he said. “These are people with certain special needs, they need constant help … Many of them have been bedridden for years.” The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, made a “desperate plea” for eastern Europe to provide Russian-made aircraft to Ukraine during a call with US senators on Saturday, said the chamber’s majority leader, Chuck Schumer. “These planes are very much needed. And I will do all I can to help the administration to facilitate their transfer,” Schumer said in a statement. On Friday night Zelenskiy had lashed out at Nato for ruling out a no-fly zone, saying it gave a “green light for further bombing of Ukrainian cities and villages”. “All the people who die from this day forward will also die because of you, because of your weakness, because of your lack of unity,” the Ukrainian president said in an emotional address, in which he praised the bravery of the Ukrainian resistance. Nato said on Friday that a no-fly zone could provoke full-fledged war in Europe with nuclear-armed Russia, causing far greater loss of life.

The US government has warned American citizens living or travelling in Russia to “depart immediately” in new guidelines published today by the US state department.
Volodymyr Zelenskiy reportedly made a “desperate plea” for eastern Europe to provide Russian-made aircraft to Ukraine. In a call with US senators, he is also understood to have called for a no-fly zone, lethal aid, a ban on Russian oil and a suspension of Visa and Mastercard in Russia. 
Partial ceasefire talks in the cities of Volnovakha and Mariupol are “ongoing” after Ukraine accused Russia of continuing attacks despite agreeing to allow civilians to flee. Ukraine has said attacks on the cities continued on Saturday, meaning the evacuation of civilians had to be halted.
Vladimir Putin has said Ukraine’s statehood will be threatened if its leaders continued to resist his military invasion. He also described western sanctions on Russia as being akin to a declaration of war.
The number of refugees fleeing the Russian invasion could reach 1.5 million by the end of the weekend, the head of the UN refugee agency has said. The figure is currently above 1.3 million.
Zelenskiy said Nato has given the “green light for further bombing of Ukraine” by ruling out a no-fly zone. He said: “All the people who die from this day forward will also die because of you, because of your weakness, because of your lack of unity.”
Nato warned on Friday that imposing a no-fly zone could provoke full-fledged war in Europe with nuclear-armed Russia. “The only way to implement a no-fly zone is to send Nato fighter planes into Ukraine’s airspace, and then impose that no-fly zone by shooting down Russian planes,” Nato chief Jens Stoltenberg said.
Britain has urged UK nationals to consider leaving Russia following Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine. “If your presence in Russia is not essential, we strongly advise that you consider leaving by remaining commercial routes,” the Foreign Office said.
Italian police have seized villas and yachts worth at least €140m (£115m) from four high-profile Russians who were placed on an EU sanctions list, sources told Reuters.
Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant, the largest of its kind in Europe, was seized by Russian forces on Friday, after an attack that started a fire close to one of its six reactors. No release of radiation was reported, but Ukrainian officials said workers had not been able to check all the safety infrastructure in the wake of the attack.
An emergency summit of the UN security council was summoned after the attack on Zaporizhzhia.

33,,,,"Saturday, 5 March 2022",2022-03-05,No-fly zones would escalate the Ukraine war – but they shouldn’t be off the table,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/mar/05/no-fly-zones-ukraine-war-escalation,"Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has made passionate arguments for protection for his nation from the air, asking “how many people must be blown up, how many legs, arms, heads must be torn off and fly away?” before supporters of Ukraine are compelled to “close the skies” and instigate a no-fly zone? This call has been repeated by protesters, politicians and pundits around the world. No-fly zones are designed to deny the use of airspace – and engage with aircraft, usually with hostile intent, that refuse to comply and fly into them. They involve the surveillance of an area of airspace to detect any incursions into it by aircraft. They also require combat fighter aircraft with the capability to intercept any incursions; these interceptors can try to escort enemy aircraft out of the zone or, as a last resort, shoot them down.  Nato chief warns of worse suffering in Ukraine and Russian attacks elsewhereRead more The UK government, along with the US and other nations, has been emphatic in its rejection of any attempt to enforce a no-fly zone over Ukraine. It has argued that this could result in escalation and would not, in any case, protect the people of Ukraine from the horrific bombardment they are suffering from ground-based artillery. Critics would say that setting this red line so early in the conflict might be perceived as weakness by Vladimir Putin. By taking options off the table, the nations rallying for Ukraine put themselves in an inherently disadvantageous position, creating an “escalation paradox” – if any action from the west that isn’t solely reactive to Russia’s activities is ruled out, then we are destined to remain reactive in perpetuity. Weighing the possibilities, a no-fly zone over Ukraine presents unique challenges. It would be significantly more demanding than anything coalitions have done in the past: this is a raging conflict, not a peace support situation. This is not a comparable potential endeavour with, say, the Iraq no-fly zones. There, around 50 aircraft policed a nation with limited air power capabilities over an area less than half the size of Ukraine by launching air patrols for a couple of hours a day. Attempting to control Ukraine’s airspace 24/7 would be completely different and a hugely challenging operation, organisationally speaking. Putin’s forces present a different order of capability, armed as they are with sophisticated air defence weapons. On top of that, agreeing to rules of engagement – such as whether to destroy Putin’s anti-aircraft defences, manned by Russian soldiers, and likely based in Russia and Belarus as well as Ukraine – would be challenging. It would raise the question of attacking or engaging forces in countries outside Ukraine. While there is disagreement about the practicality and downstream effects of a no-fly zone, one thing is clear: Putin would oppose any attempts to police Ukraine’s airspace, thus challenging the enforcers to try to shoot Russian aircraft out of the sky. Clearly, given Putin’s unpredictability, combined with the threats he has made to use nuclear weapons, there is serious concern that enforcing a no-fly zone could result in escalation at the nuclear level. Even if that doesn’t happen, if Russia attacks “coalition” aircraft then there is concern this could trigger Nato’s article 5 and, as the UK defence secretary, Ben Wallace, has said, thereby start a wider European war. Clearly, that would be in none of our interests, nor would it make the situation for Ukrainians on the ground any better. Russia appears to have no way out as Putin goes ‘all in’ Read more However, there is a valid debate to be had about the public handling and messaging around the potential of a no-fly zone by states. The UK government has been careful to point out that at each juncture it has been Putin who has escalated the situation. By implication, a coalition no-fly zone would represent an escalation on the part of the west, and the government sees this as unacceptable. It argues that a no-fly zone would make the UK an active participant in the conflict. Given its commitments to arm and back Ukraine, that argument is moot – the UK is already involved. In saying that only the Russians are escalating, the UK government is implying that doing anything other than reacting to events is too aggressive. This feels like boxing ourselves into a corner. If we can’t take the initiative because that’s also “escalating”, we are supporting the Ukrainians with one hand tied behind our back. Is a no-fly zone the panacea that will change the course of events in Ukraine? Probably not. And it risks taking the conflict into a much broader and darker arena given Putin’s threats and irrationality. The sad fact is that a no-fly zone that ushers in a third world war still fails to protect Ukrainians from the barrage of fire they face from heavy artillery that is being illegally targeted at them from Putin’s ground troops, while potentially diverting attention and operational focus from Ukraine itself. But should escalation, on the part of the massive majority of the globe that supports Ukraine and rejects Putin’s horrific actions, be permanently removed from the table of options? I believe not.

Ben Nunn, who advised Starmer for four years, said the Labour leader had brought “clarity where previously there had been ambiguity” about support for Nato, allowing the party to appear “once again a government-in-waiting” in its response to the invasion of Ukraine.  Starmer said on Sunday he fully supported the UK government’s actions, given he believed Russian president Vladimir Putin hoped to divide western countries. However, the Labour leader has called for ministers to pursue faster and tougher sanctions. Writing in the Guardian, Nunn said Starmer was “well versed in matters of national security” as a former human rights lawyer. Recalling the response to the Salisbury poisoning, Nunn said Starmer was “firm on where he wanted to stand” and that “Russia should be condemned for their involvement and we should fully back the action being taken by the government.” By contrast, Nunn said, on his way to film an episode of Question Time in March 2018 with Starmer, who was then shadow Brexit secretary, an article by Corbyn was published which contained “no condemnation of Russia for the attack”. Corbyn wrote for the Guardian at the time that either the poisonings were a “crime authored by the Russian state; or that state has allowed these deadly toxins to slip out of the control it has an obligation to exercise”. He said that Russian authorities “must be held to account on the basis of the evidence” but added the UK should “not manufacture a division over Russia where none exists” and told people not to “rush way ahead of the evidence”. Corbyn also cited “flawed intelligence and dodgy dossiers” from previous international crises, saying these had become “overwhelmed by emotion and hasty judgments too many times”. “I remember my stomaching sinking. How on earth can we defend this?” Nunn wrote. He said that on the television that night, Starmer “turned up, contradicted Corbyn, condemned Russia ‘without reservation’, backed the government and demanded strong action”. Nunn continued: “It’s often underestimated how damaging that moment was for Labour. At best the response was confused, at worst it appeared ambivalent about terrorism on British soil. “It fed into a narrative with voters that when it came to our nation’s security Labour was soft and an even deeper sense that we were no longer a party that would stand up for Britain. “Changing that perception has been a fundamental part of Keir’s mission since he became leader two years ago.” Nunn said he firmly believed Starmer should deliver speeches with the union jack behind him to demonstrate Labour was a patriotic party and that its leader was “proud to stand with our nation’s flag”, and derided those who treated the measure “flippantly”. As well as the political optics, Nunn said Starmer’s support for national security was also rooted in principles. Corbyn’s office was contacted for comment. His allies believe his response to the Salisbury poisoning has been drastically misrepresented. They pointed to his calls in the same article in March 2018 for a crackdown on Russian oligarchs’ influence in the UK, which are now being taken forward by the government. Corbyn himself has also previously accused Putin of rigging elections, and accused the Russian leader of being guilty of war crimes in Syria. The former Labour leader, who stood down in April 2020, said after the invasion of Ukraine that “we have to apply political pressure on Russia and support the public pressure that’s there in Russia to end this war and withdraw those Russian forces”. He added: “All wars end with a political solution … Why don’t we cut out the fighting zone and go straight into the talking zone?” Tensions have grown between the incumbent and previous Labour leadership teams over their approaches to military conflict, particularly the Stop the War coalition. Starmer last month said the group were naive and “actively give succour to authoritarian leaders who directly threaten democracies”. But Corbyn said “there is no evidence anywhere they’ve done anything other than stand up for peace around the world.”",,,,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7e26a4fdac72260e0b1e679aa85df9a2dde3cccc/0_170_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=7102e4c85d34979eccfb7f643fadc67f

This is nonsense. It is possible to recognise that Ukraine requires the imposition of sanctions on Russia by the west and a ready supply of western arms and money to defend itself, without believing that the west has suddenly transmogrified into a sainted power bloc, cleansed of all past sins. To choose pacifism in the current circumstances is to opt for a groundless idealism over realpolitik. Ukrainian self-determination needs guns and money. To stand against the demand to arm Ukraine is to stand for Ukraine’s defeat. If Stop the War believes that there is nothing progressive about Vladimir Putin’s Russia, then it should want his invasion driven back and his regime’s financial lifeline choked off. Laughably, some on the left have even dragged out the old “the main enemy is at home” slogan – as if the UK was actually at war with Russia rather than simply seeking to support Ukraine.  Believing that it’s necessary to oppose Putin’s attempt to drown Ukraine’s right to exist doesn’t mean turning a blind eye to Boris Johnson’s venality or to the proto-fascist leanings of Poland and Hungary, or to alibi the US’s own history of bloody anti-democratic interventions. Right now, though, calling for no sanctions against Russia and no arms to Ukraine means calling for Putin’s victory and its devastating consequences. Orwell was right in 1942 and he would say the same now. Faced with the current circumstances: “Pacifism is objectively pro-fascist.”Nick MossLondon Andy Beckett’s argument is full of contradictions. He claims that Stop the War upholds the right of the Ukrainian people to “self-determination” as well as Russia’s security concerns. What planet is he on? Russia has invaded a peaceful sovereign democracy and is bombing indiscriminately, killing civilians as well as attacking a nuclear power station. Keir Starmer was right to threaten to expel the Labour MPs who signed a Stop the War statement. Let’s hope that none of them ever become foreign secretary. We all want a just peace.June PurvisPortsmouth It was a relief to read Andy Beckett’s warning about attempts to silence voices for peace. Guns and bombs have always been the foundation of UK foreign policy, and since the country’s acquisition of atom bombs, the two main parties have held the line together. It is pitiful therefore that Labour MPs who expressed their views by signing a letter should be threatened with expulsion (Report, 2 March). I long to live in a country that focuses its foreign policy on cooperation to end war and poverty, and to save our species from extinction, whether by nuclear war or climate change. Diana FrancisBath Andy Beckett’s article has some resonance for me on how we challenge oppression. War is the ultimate oppressive force and those who lead us into it are the ultimate oppressors. Pacifists are activists. We do not stand back in our opposition to oppression, we stand firmly against it. Oppression grows when violence, militarism and war are the mechanisms that we use against it. Stop the War is challenging the oppression of war actively and incisively: it is not sitting on the fence, it is not giving succour to “our enemies”, it is making a stand for human freedom and crying out that another way is possible.Richard AshwellWolverhampton While peace is nearly always preferable to war, sometimes there is a case for a just war, as argued by the Catholic philosopher Thomas Aquinas. The best example of this was the second world war to defeat fascism. Arguably, the same applies to efforts to defeat Vladimir Putin in Ukraine. I have supported Stop the War previously, when I marched against the Iraq war. But it is misguided on Nato expansion and arming Ukraine. Nato responded to requests from former Soviet satellites to join because of their fears of Russia. Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine shows the wisdom of these requests. By arming Ukraine, Nato can at least give it a fighting chance of defending itself without being drawn into a direct conflict with Russia that would spark a war engulfing the whole of Europe.Dr Michael HerronLondon Lindsey German’s article (We at Stop the War condemn the invasion of Ukraine, and warmongers on all sides, 4 March) is full of the misinterpretation of history. She refers to the breakup of the Warsaw pact and says Nato should have also been dissolved. But the pact was never a partnership of equals. It was a Russian empire. Diplomacy down the barrel of a gun. Nato wasn’t formed to defend against the Soviet Union. It was formed to defend against Russia and its vassals. As soon as the countries that had been invaded by Russia saw a chance for freedom they ran to Nato and the EU in the rightful belief that one day Russia would try to re-subjugate them. Stop the War restates Russian claims that Nato is a threat, but it poses no threat to Russia, only to Russian imperialist ambitions. Nobody is a “war enthusiast”. But faced with a bloodthirsty invader, Ukraine has no option other than to defend itself and we have a moral responsibility to assist it. Should we sit back and allow this atrocity? Putin’s stated objectives allow no room for diplomacy. No country can accept an ultimatum to become the vassal of another. Self-defence is no offence.Jeff BloomLondon Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

In a call with the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, on Sunday afternoon, the prime minister said support for those resisting the invasion was growing “every day”.  The pair discussed the deteriorating humanitarian situation in Ukraine, with Johnson directly blaming Russia for breaches of ceasefires meant to allow aid to travel through safe corridors to people stranded without water and food for days. In a fresh indication that he believed Russian soldiers were committing war crimes, Johnson said they were posing an increasing threat to civilians – with residential tower blocks targeted by missiles. Zelenskiy said he informed Johnson on the latest efforts to fight back, and that they both condemned “war crimes of Russia” and “nuclear terrorism” – a reference to the Russian army surrounding Ukraine’s biggest atomic plant, in the south-eastern region of Zaporizhzhia. Downing Street said they discussed the “urgent needs” of Ukraine’s military, and that Johnson “undertook to work with partners to provide further defensive equipment”. It came after Dominic Raab, the deputy prime minister and justice secretary, admitted it could take months or years for Putin to be defeated in his conquest of Ukraine. He said people who thought the crisis could be resolved in days were “deluding themselves” and that Nato would need to “show some strategic stamina” in its effort to force the Russian army to retreat. 01:04Journalists and residents run from shelling in Irpin, Ukraine – video As the war in eastern Europe reached its 11th day, Raab said the Russian president, VladimirPutin, was resorting to “ever more brutal tactics to try and wrest back the initiative” given the military campaign run from Moscow had “stuttered”.

He said it would provoke a more “direct military conflict” between the western defensive alliance and Russia, marking a “massive escalation” in tensions. “That feeds Putin’s narrative,” Raab said. “Putin wants to say that he’s actually in a struggle with the west. He’s not. This is an illegal invasion of a neighbour whose self-determination, democratic and territorial integrity needs to be protected.

For a few years, there has been something, somebody, moving in the shadow of the stage curtain. Only a few people felt they recognised it. But language noticed. Even 10 years ago, big-power war in Europe was “unthinkable these days. Do try and keep up!” Then, somehow, it became “well, in theory, but just utterly unlikely”. So, thinkable again. Hard to say when that mental border was crossed; perhaps after the Yugoslav wars, perhaps in 2014 when Vladimir Putin annexed Crimea and sponsored proxy war in the Donbas region. And now they ask: “What sort of European war is this going to be? And how nuclear? And where will the next one start?”  History doesn’t repeat itself. It just tries to remember an old song it heard once. It may be that Putin’s 24 February 2022 will turn out to be like Hitler’s 22 June 1941 – the day he invaded Russia, doomed himself and Germany to destruction and made inevitable a divided Europe whose Cold War and barbed wire would last for half a century. But Putin isn’t Hitler. He will die a disappointed old nuisance in exile somewhere, rather than by Heldentod suicide in his bunker. Both men qualify as psychopathic dictators, swaddled from reality in fantasies of geopolitical revenge. But Putin’s grip on the Russian imagination is weaker than Hitler’s on the Germans. And his use of police terror against his own people, though horrifying, is distinctly less effective. All the same, that wise historian Margaret MacMillan sees one desperately important parallel. Both men have meant what they said. And in both cases they were not taken seriously until it was too late. Hitler raved on in public about getting rid of the Jews and conquering Lebensraum in eastern Europe. But the “other Hitler”, in private, could sometimes talk quite charmingly and constructively about possible agreements. Obviously, foreign visitors concluded, the public stuff was just for show while the “serious” Hitler was revealing his real mind. Diametrically wrong! The crazy speeches gave his true intentions; the sober reflections over coffee were all lies. With Putin, the west wrote off his increasingly wild talk about breaking Nato’s encirclement and restoring Russia’s dominion over post-Soviet space. He couldn’t be serious. Under the bluster, wasn’t there still that shrewd, cautious Putin with whom one could do business? But Ukraine proves the opposite. The imperial dream is what he means. The meetings with western leaders across that long table, hinting at terms for a bargain, were all fake. At the moment of writing, Putin’s plan seems to have two stages. First, military victory, achieved mainly by isolating resistance in a few cities and then shelling them to blackened husks, as the Russians did to Grozny in Chechnya. Armed resistance might continue, especially in the hills and forests of western Ukraine. But Putin may recall how Stalin fought Ukrainian nationalist guerrillas for years after the Second World War, without letting those murderous repressions distract the Soviet Union as a whole. Next, regime change. That’s unlikely to mean some temporary junta to supervise complete abolition of Ukrainian independence and annexation by Russia. More probably, it means the installation of a puppet government in Kyiv, to run a cut-down, smaller Ukrainian protectorate pledged to support Russian foreign and defence policies. Suddenly, the world is very dangerous again. And the real danger is not primarily mad dictators. It is uncertainty Volodymyr Zelenskiy and Ukraine’s legal government are already targets. Russian special forces may try to kidnap the president, stuffing syringes into him and flying him to some Russian “psychiatric clinic”. Just possibly, he might not survive “an attempted escape”. In August 1968, Alexander Dubček and his colleagues in Prague were kidnapped and flown to Moscow. But that case was easier. Dubček was held guilty of anti-socialist policy – “socialism with a human face” – rather than of defending the sovereignty of Czechoslovakia. Zelenskiy stands simply for the full freedom and independence of his country. For a Russian mind like Putin’s, that is much harder to forgive. But finding cadres to form that puppet government will unfortunately not be hard. Since independence in 1991, Ukrainian politics have been poisoned by fewer than a dozen billionaire oligarchs and their paid henchmen in the Rada (parliament). Some have even led governments. Most of them, not quite all, are at once corrupt and treacherous. They hold investments and property in both Ukraine and Russia and when in trouble they take cover in Moscow. Given enough bodyguard protection, and assisted by pro-Russian figures imported from th Donbas, such men would willingly slink into government in Kyiv. And here history is indeed trying to remember an old song: Moscow’s obsessive wish to paralyse and subjugate the space between Russia and western Europe. A wish that didn’t begin with Putin, or with Stalin’s ring of satellites, but 300 years ago with Peter the Great and later, above all, with the Empress Catherine. Back then, the space was filled by the old Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, including most of western Ukraine. For many years, threats, intrigues and Russian infantry kept the country submissive. But then Poland rebelled, reclaiming its independence. In 1792, Catherine sent the Russian armies in, supported by a clutch of wealthy pro-Russian magnates in the Confederation of Targowica. They tried to govern. But a huge uprising followed and in 1795 Catherine, with Austria and Prussia, wiped Poland off the map for over a century. Now Ukraine may face its own Targowica. But just as the great partition crime concentrated a new, militant confidence in Polish identity, it looks as if the invasion of 2022 is completing Ukraine’s transition from early self-doubt to a solid faith in Ukraine as an authentic national community. Europe itself, woken by explosions, stumbles out into a different landscape. When we fell asleep, no longer required for Cold War sentry duty, the red lines were faded and in places scuffed away. The tripwires of military pacts hung slack and rusty. Now, suddenly, the world is very dangerous again. And the real danger is not primarily mad dictators attacking their neighbours. It is uncertainty. It is not being sure what will happen, what will be triggered, if somebody marches over the half-scuffed-away line or pushes through the sagging wire. It’s said that the First World War began because there were too many treaties tangled across Europe. The truth, perhaps, is that there were not enough treaties, none unambiguously laying down who would go to war with whom over what. We have to repaint that red line, replace and tauten the tripwire. If Nato governments have private reservations about Article 5 – mutual assistance by all if one is attacked – we are doomed. Die for Estonia? Yes, we must be prepared to die for Estonia and the world must be sure that we are. We know now that Putin “means it”. Do we mean it? In the future, post-Putin, we will need to court Russia into partnership. Perhaps into Mikhail Gorbachev’s dream of a “common European home”, in which all are members of a single defence pact. But that means recognising that not all Russia’s historical grievances are propaganda. At the 1990 Berlin meeting, the Soviet side left believing that it had a statement that Nato would not extend up to its borders – in return for Soviet acceptance that the whole of a united Germany could join the pact. But later the west said that there was never any statement and brought Poland and the other post-communist states into Nato. After the civil war, George Washington was persuaded to give Will Leslie a full military funeral. Photograph: Stock Montage/Getty Images Jacques Faure, once French ambassador in Kyiv, says carefully: “That is not to say that … there were no such statements. But we don’t know, because there are no records or written documents.” Putin’s claim that Nato plans to encircle and strangle Russia is absurd. But many Russians, not just the Kremlin crew, believe that their country was swindled in its hour of weakness. It’s an abscess that needs treatment. Russians and Ukrainians will also have to find their way back together. These are two densely interlaced peoples, who have no business killing each other. A few years ago, I was taken to a graveyard in rural New Jersey, where Will Leslie, a young Scot in the British army, was buried after the battle of Princeton in 1777. Benjamin Rush, the American revolutionary who found his body, had been Will’s best friend; he had lodged for years with the Leslie family in Edinburgh while the two boys attended the university there together. Rush fell in love with Will’s sister, but she was too young for marriage and he had to return to America. When the war of independence came, the two found themselves on opposite sides. After Princeton, Benjamin went looking for Will and discovered him in a cart, where he had died of wounds. He persuaded General Washington to give him a full military funeral, and sat down to write a heartbroken letter to the Leslies in Edinburgh. Scots and Americans were no further apart in 1777 than Ukrainians and Russians are today. Somewhere among the ruins, a silent Serhii is looking down on a dead Vadim, who once shared home and college and friends with him in St Petersburg. This conflict has the special horror of civil war between brothers. But by the time we say “Never again!”, it is always too late.

As long as the will to fight exists, the country’s soldiers and citizens can hope to wear down, even to repulse, the Russian invaders. But their dilemma is a terrible one. As Vladimir Putin’s bombardments grow more barbarous and indiscriminate, the human cost of resistance is rising daily. If they hold on, will the western powers belatedly come to their rescue? Time does not favour Russia’s president. Casualties are increasing. His Nazi-style military blitzkrieg didn’t work. His conscripts are reportedly demoralised, his war machine may bog down. His hubris is destroying Russia’s economy. Protests at home reflect a new political vulnerability. Putin is being tracked by war crimes prosecutors in The Hague.  For any rational leader, an immediate ceasefire, accompanied by a bogus claim of victory, would be an obvious way out. But logic and reason play no part in Putin’s “thinking”. This catastrophe recalls Iraq in 2003. How could anyone, however delusional, possibly believe a full-scale invasion was a good idea? The man Donald Trump calls a “genius” turns out to be really stupid. To avoid defeat – to eventually win – Ukrainian resistance forces will need the west’s sustained, long-term military, logistical, financial and intelligence support. Will the allies, fresh from their Afghan cop-out, stay the course this time? Nato combat jets are nowhere to be seen in Ukraine’s skies – but there’s a whiff of betrayal in the air. Volodymyr Zelenskiy, Ukraine’s president, wants instant EU membership. He was cheered at the European parliament last week – but he will not get his wish. Kyiv is pleading for a Nato-patrolled no-fly zone to help stop the merciless bombing of cities such as Mariupol and Kharkiv. That isn’t happening, either. Ukraine’s people are determined to fight on. It’s impossible not to admire them – but also impossible, or so western leaders appear to say, to protect them from mass murder. Such bravery underscores the grave responsibility of western governments. Britain and the US, in particular, have encouraged resistance, sending missiles and lethal aid. Raising the stakes, Boris Johnson and Joe Biden portray the war as a defining struggle between freedom and tyranny, democracy and authoritarianism. That’s not the sort of war you can afford to lose. Most European countries, plus Australia, Japan, Canada and others, have pledged open-ended backing, too. For the first time, the EU will supply weaponry. This is all very dramatic, perhaps suspiciously so. Should Ukrainians trust these sweeping promises? What if the war lasts five or 10 years, which is not unusual for such conflicts? Fuelling an apparently endless, widely destabilising insurgency will require grit and consistency in London and other capitals. Few western politicians, eyeing the next election, display such qualities. How long, for example, will German voters’ current outrage outlast the impact of higher bills and taxes to pay for non-Russian gas and vastly increased defence spending? How long will Biden stay engaged if the crisis turns into a grinding war of attrition? He could be a lame duck after November’s midterms. Possible 2024 replacements, such as Trump, have a very different view of Nato and Russia. The longevity and reliability of public and political support for Ukraine is one question. Another will be how to meet the resistance’s need for an unceasing flow of arms, assistance, and staging posts and safe havens outside Ukrainian territory. Extended cross-border warfare would ineluctably suck in alliance countries The probability that displaced fighters, plus a European “foreign legion”, will seek bases in neighbouring Nato members – from which to launch attacks on the occupiers – is strong. Remember how the mujahideen, fighting the Red Army, and later the Taliban, fighting Nato, operated from Pakistan. Extended cross-border warfare would ineluctably suck in alliance countries. It would be viewed by Putin as the product not of unextinguished Ukrainian nationalism but of US-plotted regime change. If Russia, over time, continues to suffer significant losses to a western-backed resistance, Putin will take the war to the west. This is exactly the dangerous escalation Biden and Nato say they are determined to avoid, which supposedly justifies their refusal of a no-fly zone. It’s the “third world war” nightmare scenario Ben Wallace, the UK defence secretary, warns against. But how to dispel it? Uncertain, too, is the west’s ability to maintain the unusual unity of purpose lauded by a too self-congratulatory Biden in last week’s State of the Union address. The EU is likewise proud of its united stance and tough sanctions package. But big gaps and internal differences remain. Revenue-spinning Russian oil and gas still flow. The banking bans have large loopholes. Even the best-laid sanctions regimes crumble over time. And despite an initially generous EU welcome, the expected huge increases in refugee numbers, if the war drags on, will exacerbate existing tensions in Europe and the UK. Worries about an unvanquished Putin going on to threaten other former Soviet republics, as Biden predicts he might, are also intensifying. The defeatist argument goes like this: Ukraine, sadly, is already lost. Better to concentrate on ensuring the Baltic republics and similarly vulnerable states do not go the same way. The paradox is that the more successful and long-lived Ukraine’s resistance is, the bigger the dangers for Nato. Yet if by supporting it, the allies cannot ultimately avoid being drawn into conflict with Russia, why delay the inevitable? In other words: rather than leave the fighting, and the dying, to Ukrainians alone – and then eventually abandon them – the western democracies should put their air combat forces on standby, declare their intention to impose a no-fly zone – and tell the Kremlin to stop the killing. Putin’s slaughter of innocents is unbearable, yet we are forced to watch. Will the west fight to the last Ukrainian? Or will it stand up and fight for itself?",,,,

But it is Vladimir Putin of Russia who has made the contest more immediate and literal than anyone expected, launching a bloody invasion of Ukraine that threatens to bring down a new iron curtain in Europe.  State of the Union: Joe Biden pledges to make Putin pay for Ukraine invasionRead more Biden, who made no mention of Putin, Russia or nuclear weapons in his inaugural address, is discovering a truism of US history: American presidencies are often defined by crises that no one saw coming. “I am old enough to remember [British prime minister] Harold Macmillan who, when asked what was driving his actions, replied, ‘Events, dear boy, events’,” said Bill Galston, a former policy adviser to President Bill Clinton. “I’m sure when Joe Biden was running for president, the last thing on his mind was a revival of the cold war. “He was already focused, and has been for years, on the conflict between democracy and autocracy but that was more of a frame for looking at the world than it was an operational manual. Now here we are. It’s truly extraordinary when you think about it.” Just as Biden’s empathy was seen as ideal for meeting the moment of the coronavirus pandemic, and just as his record of bipartisanship was thought to be well suited to healing America’s divisions, so his storied foreign policy experience and faith in multinational institutions appear to bode well for this test. That is certainly the view of Democrats who believe that Biden, who at 79 lived every moment of the cold war, including its gnawing dread of nuclear annihilation, has risen to the occasion. Last month he authorised $350m of military equipment – the biggest such package in US history – to bolster Ukraine’s courageous fighters who have exceeded all expectations. Firefighters work to extinguish a fire at a damaged logistic center after shelling in Kyiv, Ukraine, on Thursday. Photograph: Efrem Lukatsky/AP He led an unprecedented declassification of intelligence about Russia’s intentions to invade and to justify its actions, weakening Moscow’s arguments on the world stage. Biden and his team held countless meetings and phone calls to rally western allies, helping imbue Nato with a sense of unity and purpose that many feared it had lost forever. The resulting sanctions imposed have gone further than many expected in scope and scale and could collapse the Russian economy. Galston, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution thinktank in Washington, commented: “The Ukraine crisis has been the Biden administration’s finest hour. The president and his senior officials have been skillful and tireless in trying to coordinate a united response. The results speak for themselves. The sanctions are extraordinary and even more extraordinary has been the turnaround in European thinking and policy. It’s been breathtakingly fast.” It depends on what your definition of success is. The supporters of Biden say Nato’s united. And Ukraine is in ashesJohn Bolton But all this represents a hollow victory, critics say, because the harsh reality is that it did not prevent Putin making his move and inflicting horrific civilian casualties in Ukraine. Biden’s radical transparency included stating early and forcefully that no American troops would set foot in the country. John Bolton, a former national security adviser to Trump, said: “It depends on what your definition of success is. The supporters of Biden say Nato’s united and I think that’s true. And Ukraine is in ashes.” He added: “I don’t think collectively the west did what was necessary here and you can measure failure pretty clearly by the Russian army being in Ukraine. I don’t think we view our current position with equanimity.” The US and Nato have rejected appeals to impose a “no-fly” zone, which might require their forces to shoot down Russian aircraft and draw them directly into a war with a nuclear power led by a dangerously unstable tyrant. This earned a rebuke from Volodymyr Zelenskiy, Ukraine’s president, who said on Friday that Nato “gave the green light for further bombing of Ukrainian cities and villages”. Bolton, a former interim US ambassador to the UN, believes the opportunity for such a measure has been lost. “It’s not practical because we’ve waited this long and Biden and the UK and all of Nato have basically said, we’re not going to do it.” The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, left, walks with the European Council president, Charles Michel, during an extraordinary EU foreign ministers meeting in Brussels on Friday. The Biden administration has won praise for maintaining unity among US allies. Photograph: Olivier Douliery/AP “But everybody in Europe better get used to the fact that we’re going to watch something on the continent that we said in 1945 we’d never let happen again. And it’s going to happen, I think, right in front of us.” The war in Ukraine has given an unexpected boost to Biden’s efforts to revive bipartisanship in Washington. Republicans have been broadly supportive and gave him several standing ovations when he discussed the conflict at the start of his State of the Union address last week. But the truce only goes so far. Some Republicans argue that Biden’s botched withdrawal from Afghanistan betrayed weakness and encouraged Putin and that the invasion would not have happened if Trump was still in the White House. They say the sanctions have been too slow and incremental. And they are joining Democrats in pushing the president to ban Russian oil imports while calling for American energy independence. Forty years of foreign affairs experience by President Biden is paying offLeon Panetta Biden, however, has been reluctant to call out his Republican critics so far, and his approval rating has begun to climb since the crisis began, according to a PBSNewsHour/NPR/Marist poll. About half of the American public – 52% – said this week they support how the president is handling the situation in Ukraine. This was up from two weeks ago when about a third said they approved. Leon Panetta, a former defense secretary and CIA director, said: “Forty years of foreign affairs experience by President Biden is paying off. We weren’t sure with Afghanistan but it clearly is paying off now in the way he’s been able to establish a unified approach between the US and our Nato allies. The bottom line is that we could not have made Putin pay a price were it not for that unity.” There appears to have been determination not repeat the blunders of Afghanistan, when allies felt blindsided as the Taliban rapidly took over and the US and western governments fled. Panetta, co-founder of the Panetta Institute for Public Policy, added: “Presidents are always tested by crisis but presidents have to learn from their mistakes and I think President Biden knows what he did wrong and knows now what he has to do to provide that leadership. “In some ways I thought Afghanistan was kind of his Bay of Pigs but John Kennedy was able to come back and really establish a strong foreign policy and I’m hoping that Joe Biden can do the same. He will be tested but, having put together this unified approach, I feel confident that he will now see it see it through. You have to remain strong. You can’t blink when it comes to dealing with Putin.” 04:41 'I can't believe this is happening': the refugees trying to escape Ukraine – video",,,,

Russia-Ukraine war: Biden and Zelenskiy discuss more support for Ukraine as Visa, Mastercard pull out of Russia - liveRead more 6 Mar 202205.01SummaryRussia’s war on its neighbour continues for its tenth day and well into its second week. It is 7am in Ukraine and here is where the situation currently stands:
US president Joe Biden spoke with Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, to discuss ongoing efforts to impose sanctions on Russia and speed up US military, humanitarian and economic assistance. The White House said during the call the pair also discussed talks between Russia and Ukraine, but offered no additional details.
Britain’s prime minister Boris Johnson issued a six-point plan in reaction to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and is urging other leaders to endorse it in efforts to ensure Russia fails in its apparent attempt to take over its democratic neighbour.
Zelenskiy also said he spoke to SpaceX and Tesla boss Elon Musk, announcing the country will receive more of its Starlink satellite internet terminals this coming week.
US-based credit card giants Visa and Mastercard announced they will suspend their Russian business operations.
The Ukrainian military said Russian forces continue to focus on Kyiv while moving ahead with assaults on Kharkiv, Mykolaiv and the creation of a land corridor with Crimea, in its latest operational report. The report said aircraft from airports in Belarusian territory were involved in air strikes on military and civilian infrastructure in Kyiv and Zhytomyr.
US-based think tank and policy research organisation, the Institute for the Study of War, released a report saying Russian forces in Ukraine may have entered a possibly brief operational pause as they prepare to resume operations against Kyiv, Kharkiv, Mykolayiv, and possibly Odesa in the next 24-48 hours.
The relief effort to distribute humanitarian aid to Ukraine has stepped up as volunteers across the country work tirelessly to gather basic necessities to give to refugees and prepare food supplies for the army to be sent to the frontline.
The humanitarian situation in the southern Ukrainian port of Mariupol is “catastrophic” and it is vital that civilians be evacuated, a senior official from the NGO Doctors Without Borders warned.
The International Monetary Fund announced it could approve $1.4 billion emergency funding as early as next week as the body warns of war’s “severe impact” on the global economy.
Western sanctions on Russia are a stumbling block to revived Iran nuclear deal, Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov said.
Ukrainian foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba met with US secretary of state Antony Blinken, saying Ukraine “will win this war” but needs more help from Nato.
Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dymtro Kuleba, appealed for more military assistance while Reuters reports Zelenskiy made a “desperate plea” for eastern Europe to provide Russian-made aircraft to Ukraine. In a call with US senators, he is also understood to have called for a no-fly zone, lethal aid, a ban on Russian oil and a suspension of Visa and Mastercard in Russia.
The US is reportedly in discussions with Poland on the possibility of Poland providing more fighter jets to Ukraine with the US potentially agreeing to backfill Poland’s fleet of fighter planes if Warsaw decides to transfer its used MiG-29s to Ukraine, four US officials told POLITICO.
Russia and Ukraine plan another round of talks on Monday, even though previous talks that produced an agreement to a limited ceasefire in order to protect corridors for civilian have not been honoured by Russia.
The United Nations recorded 351 civilians killed and 707 injured in Ukraine, according to the UN high commissioner for human rights.
Tens of thousands joined rallies around the world in support of Ukraine over the weekend, gathering in cities across Europe, the US and South America to demand an end to Russia’s invasion.

More than 1.3 million Ukrainians have crossed borders since the Russian invasion started on the 24 February in what the United Nations is now calling Europe’s fastest-moving refugee crisis since the end of the second world war.Figures released today by the United Nation’s Refugee Agency (UNHCR) show that to date 1.37 million people have fled Ukraine into neighbouring European countries after the military offensive ordered by the Russian president, Vladimir Putin.“This is the fastest-moving refugee crisis we have seen in Europe since the end of the second world war,” UNHCR head Filippo Grandi said.The vast majority of people here are women with kids and elderly people, having to spend long hours waiting in the cold for a spot on a packed train.

Ukrainian forces near Kharkiv, on the other hand, conducted a counter-offensive that reportedly penetrated to the Ukrainian-Russian border.” The institute adds that Russian troops continued to encircle, bomb, and shell Mariupol while Russian forces east of Kharkiv and in northern Luhansk Oblast appear to be trying to link up.“Russian troops around Kherson city are likely preparing to resume offensive operations against Mykolayiv and ultimately Odesa and Russian naval infantry in Crimea continue to prepare for amphibious operations, which would most likely occur near Odesa,” the assessment adds. #Russian forces in #Ukraine may have entered a possibly brief operational pause as they prepare to resume operations against #Kyiv, #Kharkiv, #Mykolayiv, and possibly #Odesa in the next 24-48 hours.

But they are no ordinary reviews,” Anastasiia Lapatina, a Ukrainian journalist and reporter for the Kyiv Independent, writes for the New York Times. “Russian troops have been bombing Kyiv and its peaceful residents for 4 days,” one review reads. “Go out in the streets — stop the deaths of children.” “By flooding places where Russians are congregating online, Ivan and the hundreds of others writing similar messages hope to spread the truth of the Kremlin’s atrocities,” Lapatina says.Since most unfavorable news has been blocked in Russia, one way that Ukrainians are trying to reach the Russian people has been to write very unique Google reviews of popular Russian cafes and restaurants.

The Biden administration didn’t oppose the Polish government giving Kyiv the MiGs, which could potentially escalate tensions between Nato and Moscow. Poland, for now, has held on to its fighter jets.“We are working with the Poles on this issue and consulting with the rest of our Nato allies,” a White House spokesperson told POLITICO. “We are also working on the capabilities we could provide to backfill Poland if it decided to transfer planes to Ukraine.”The move comes amid a frantic push to find weapons to equip Ukrainian forces as they continue to fight off the massive Russian invasion.Ukraine needs fighter jets and it needs them now. It may be the single biggest way to tilt the balance of the war at this point. The U.S. can make this happen by providing replacement guarantees to our NATO allies. Get it done!— Rep.

The Ukrainian military said its forces had been “fighting fierce battles to maintain certain borders” in its daily operational report. It claimed Russian troops had been “demoralised” and were in an “extremely low moral and psychological state” due to the resistance of the Ukrainian people, the general staff of the armed forces said.
US president Joe Biden spoke with Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, to discuss ongoing efforts to impose sanctions on Russia and speed up US military, humanitarian and economic assistance. The White House said during the call the pair also discussed talks between Russia and Ukraine, but offered no additional details.
Zelenskiy also spoke to SpaceX and Tesla boss Elon Musk, announcing the country will receive more of its Starlink satellite internet terminals this coming week.
US-based credit card giants Visa and Mastercard have announced they will suspend their Russian business operations.
Britain’s prime minister Boris Johnson has issued a six-point plan in reaction to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and is urging other leaders to endorse it in efforts to ensure Russia fails in its apparent attempt to take over its democratic neighbour.
China’s foreign minister, Wang Yi, has told the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, that Beijing opposes any moves that “add fuel to the flames” in Ukraine. Wang called for negotiations to resolve the immediate crisis, adding that the US and Europe should pay attention to the negative impact of Nato’s eastward expansion on Russia’s security. Blinken said the world is acting in unison in response to Russian aggression and ensuring that Moscow will pay a high price.
Blinken briefly stepped onto Ukrainian soil for a meeting with the foreign minister, Dymtro Kuleba, who predicted Russia would be defeated but appealed for more military assistance. Blinken also visited a welcome centre set up by Polish authorities where about 3,000 refugees are taking shelter.
Hundreds of men have been lining up in Kyiv to join the Ukrainian army. One volunteer, Volodymyr Onysko, told Sky News: “We know why we are here. We know why we defend our country. And our guys that are actually standing there and fighting Russian military forces. We know what we are doing and that’s why we will win.”
The Ukrainian military said Russian forces continue to focus on Kyiv while moving ahead with assaults on Kharkiv, Mykolaiv and the creation of a land corridor with Crimea, in its latest operational report. The report said aircraft from airports in Belarusian territory were involved in air strikes on military and civilian infrastructure in Kyiv and Zhytomyr.
Russia has dropped powerful bombs on residential areas of Chernihiv, a city north of Kyiv, according to a regional official. Vyacheslav Chaus posted a photo of what he said was an undetonated FAB-500, a Soviet-designed 500-kilogram (1,100-pound) air-dropped bomb of the kind usually used against military-industrial facilities and fortified structures.

The new penalties on Russia follows Seoul’s March 1 decision to ban transactions with seven major Russian banks and their affiliates, including Sberbank.

South Korea’s finance ministry will release details including the scope of further sanctions later on Monday, which “will be in line with U.S. financial sanctions,” a finance ministry official said.

Details of any Russian central bank assets held in won cannot be disclosed without the holder’s consent, the official said.

No country will have a bigger impact on concluding this terrible war in Ukraine than China,” Morrison said in response to a question after a speech at the Lowy Institute think tank.“I was listening for the voice of the Chinese government when it came to condemning the actions of Russia and there was a chilling silence,” he said.China has declined to call the Russian attack on Ukraine an “invasion” while asking western countries to respect Russia’s “legitimate security concerns”. It has called for a solution to the crisis through negotiations. 7 Mar 202204.02New Zealand brings in Russia Sanctions BillEva Corlett in Wellington reports that New Zealand will pass a law this week that will significantly ramp up its sanctions against Russia, including preventing those sanctioned from moving assets to New Zealand and stopping Russian super-yachts from entering the waters.The Russia Sanctions Bill is the first law of its kind in New Zealand, and is the country’s next step in its response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, prime minister Jacinda Ardern said on Monday afternoon.
“A Bill of this nature has never been brought before our Parliament, but with Russia vetoing UN sanctions we must act ourselves to support Ukraine and our partners in opposition to this invasion,” the prime minister said.

The country initially responded to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine with targeted travel bans, prohibiting exports to the military, and suspending bilateral foreign ministry consultations.

Ardern said: “We have said throughout our response that no options were off the table, and that we’d continue to do more in line with New Zealand’s unequivocal opposition to Russia’s actions. Despite international condemnation and the resilience and resistance of the Ukrainian people, Russia’s assault continues, and so must our pressure.”

The new sanctions will enable the government to freeze assets located in New Zealand, and prevent those sanctioned from moving assets to the country, or using its financial system as “a back door to get around sanctions” imposed by other countries, Ardern said. The new law will also allow for sanctions to be imposed on states that are complicit with Russia, such as Belarus.

Sanctions could also apply to trade, and financial institutions as well as stopping the likes of Russian super yachts, ships and aircraft from entering New Zealand waters or airspace.

Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy delivered an impassioned address to his nation on Sunday night, warning Russian troops he will punish those who committed atrocities in Ukraine while the “only quiet place” that awaits them is the grave. “We will not forgive. We will not forget. We will punish everyone who committed atrocities in this war on our land,” he said. 
Zelenskiy also spoke of the death of a family attempting to flee the Ukrainian city of Irpin, near Kyiv in northern Ukraine, in an emotional plea to honour humanitarian corridors that Russian forces appear to have ignored.
The Ukrainian president criticised western leaders for failing to respond to the Russian defence ministry’s announcement that it would strike Ukraine’s military-industrial complex. “I didn’t hear even a single world leader react to this. The audacity of the aggressor is a clear signal to the west that the sanctions imposed on Russia are not sufficient,” he said. 
Two major American accounting firms, KPMG and PricewaterhouseCoopers, have also announced they will stop doing business in Russia.

We must not do that,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/mar/08/ukraine-no-fly-zone-nato-russia-war,"With every passing day, with every image and video that shows how Russia is destroying Ukrainian cities and killing civilians, the calls for punitive measures against Moscow rise. While the sentiment is understandable, we need a strong dose of reality to curb some of the more emotional impulses which, taken too far, could not only fail to make our country safer – but result in the US stumbling into a catastrophic war that can be avoided. History replays like a half-forgotten song, but once we remember, it’s far too late | Neal AschersonRead more  The war between Russia and Ukraine started horribly and has only intensified since. Kharkiv has been devastated by heavy Russian bombardment. The port city of Mariupol could fall to Russian forces any moment, and vicious street fighting gets closer to the heart of Kyiv by the day. Accurate casualty figures are as yet unknown, but they are significant for the Ukrainian civil population. The reaction from the western world against Moscow has been immediate and severe. Russia has seen the most punitive and comprehensive set of sanctions levied against another country since the second world war. Moscow has been almost entirely cut off from the Swift banking system. News organizations around the world have ceased operations there and curtailed Russian media outlets in the west. Businesses the world over have suspended operations in the country. All of the measures have taken a serious toll on the Russian population. To date, however, none of it has had any discernable impact on Putin’s prosecution of the war, as his military machine continues its march through Ukraine. That apparent lack of success has many in the west contemplating the imposition of even harsher measures to punish Moscow with the eventual hope of forcing Putin to end the war and withdraw his troops. While it is entirely reasonable and appropriate to impose a serious cost on Russia for their grossly unnecessary war of choice, the west must stop to consider the ramifications of its policies before taking further action. If we let emotion have too much sway in our next steps, we could perversely worsen, materially, the West’s collective security. Some of the options under consideration from various quarters include not just sending Kyiv more arms and ammunition, but increasingly sophisticated weapons such as air defense systems, modern fighter jets, and more advanced missile systems. The governments of some European countries, such as Sweden and the UK, have not prevented their citizens and military veterans from going to Ukraine to fight the Russians. But the most dangerous idea being given increasing consideration is the establishment of a no-fly zone over Kyiv. No less than three retired four-star American generals, all former Nato supreme allied commanders, have given some degree of support to the idea of a no-fly zone in Ukraine. One of them, General Philip Breedlove, proposed a no-fly zone for humanitarian purposes, suggesting it might be tolerable to Moscow if the US says “we are not going to fire on you unless you fire on us”. Such distinctions are obviously pointless: if we enforce the zone, then by definition we have to shoot down anything that flies into it, whether it attacks our planes or not. And if anyone had any doubts about what Russia’s response would be to one of its jets being destroyed in a no-fly zone, Putin put them to rest on Friday when he said he would consider any attack in Russian aviation to be an attack on his country and respond in kind. President Zelenskiy has been outspoken in urging Nato to ignore this danger and impose a no-fly zone regardless of Putin’s comments. On Friday, he tried to shame Nato into the move by saying the alliance leaders would be responsible for Ukrainian deaths if they didn’t intervene on his behalf. “All the people who will die from this day will die because of you,” Zelensky said, accusing the alliance of “weakness” and “disunity.” The west must resolutely refuse to be drawn into the war through the Ukrainian leader’s emotional appeal While Zelensky’s desire is understandable – his nation is under vicious attack – the west must resolutely refuse to be drawn into the war through the Ukrainian leader’s emotional appeal. As bad as it is that millions are suffering in Ukraine, western leaders have obligations, first and foremost, to safeguard their populations. Fighting Russia on behalf of Zelensky would expose the populations of the entire alliance to potential attack by Moscow, which could escalate to nuclear warfare. It is crucial the west does not overreact to the war, as bad as it is. The sanctions currently in place are unprecedented in their severity and will impose a penalty on Putin that it could take upwards of a decade from which to fully recover. Moreover, regardless of how the war ends, Putin’s military is going to be severely weakened in the aftermath. Because of the strong sanctions, it would likely take Putin over a decade to rebuild Russia’s military strength to its pre-war position – which has been exposed as being far weaker than most imagined – much less to be capable of invading a Nato country. Meanwhile, because Putin has shown he is willing to use force, virtually every European country is now going to significantly increase its defense spending and put real emphasis on modernizing their own self-defense capacity, as evidenced by Berlin’s $113bn investment in its defense budget. The bottom line is that if Nato remains resolute and sober in its response to Putin’s invasion of Ukraine, refuses to get drawn into a no-win war, western security for the foreseeable future will be strengthened. Let our emotions get the best of us, however, and risk widening the war, and we may suffer far more harm than anything that has yet befallen Ukraine.

He has now encircled major Ukrainian cities with his army and threatens to flatten them with thermobaric weapons, cluster munitions and guided missiles. This will terrorize the civilian population and could demoralize the budding Ukrainian resistance. He could escalate the conflict to another region, such as the Balkans, where longstanding conflicts fester and Russia has an extensive network of intelligence and security services. He may turn the lights off in a major US city with a cyber-attack. Most frighteningly, he has raised the alert level of Russian nuclear forces and may be considering introducing martial law. Trump: US should put Chinese flags on F-22 jets and ‘bomb shit out of’ RussiaRead more  Meanwhile, Nato, the G7 and a host of other countries have turned the dial of economic punishment up to unprecedented levels. Several European nations that had previously hesitated to involve themselves militarily in the conflict have now done so, sending weapons and financing Ukraine’s resistance. A growing number of voices in Washington are clamoring for a more aggressive approach from the United States and Nato, pressuring the White House to support a Ukrainian insurgency with a broad menu of weaponry or even calling for Nato to impose a no-fly zone over Ukraine. Amid this escalation, experts can spin out an infinite number of branching scenarios on how this might end. But scores of war games conducted for the US and allied governments and my own experience as the US national intelligence officer for Europe suggest that if we boil it down, there are really only two paths toward ending the war: one, continued escalation, potentially across the nuclear threshold; the other, a bitter peace imposed on a defeated Ukraine that will be extremely hard for the United States and many European allies to swallow.  Putin deliberately frames his operation in Ukraine in the same way that the United States has framed its own regime-change operations in Kosovo, Iraq and Libya, charging that Ukraine has committed human rights violations and is a terrorist state. For good measure, Putin throws in the ludicrous assertion that Ukraine is fascist. These are transparent fig leaves for what is nothing more than a war of brute imperialism. Judging from how things stand now, Putin, having invested so much in this war already, seems unlikely to settle for anything less than the complete subjugation of the Ukrainian government. If the current uneven pace of Russian military progress doesn’t accomplish the job, the most likely strategy for doing this is to make an example of a city like Kharkiv, leveling it as if it were Grozny or Aleppo, both cities that Russia has brutally destroyed in the recent past, and then threatening to burn Kyiv to the ground. He can accompany this with special forces attacks in the capital to disrupt the civilian population and sow further confusion and discontent. Ultimately, he needs at least to force the removal of President Volodymyr Zelenskiy and his government. In this case, Russia will install a puppet government in Kyiv, which will sign terms of surrender highly favorable to Russia. The terms will almost certainly include a pledge of Ukrainian neutrality, and might go further by committing Ukraine formally to Russia’s sphere of influence with a membership in Russia’s Collective Security Treaty Organization or its Eurasian Economic Union. Putin seems unlikely to settle for anything less than the complete subjugation of the Ukrainian government At this juncture, the United States and its allies would face an extraordinarily difficult policy choice. Disgust with Putin’s war has greatly increased the chances that Washington and some of its allies would seek to fight on, for instance by supporting a Ukrainian insurgency. This would roughly mirror the strategy that the United States used to assist French resistance against Nazi Germany. The more effective Nato support to the insurgency is, the more the Kremlin would likely be willing to risk attacks on safe havens in Nato territory – most likely employing irregular forces or even the infamous Wagner Group, a private organization that operates globally as a quasi-special force of the Kremlin. These operations could lead to a massive escalation that would open the door to a much wider war between Nato and Russia – exactly the war that Joe Biden has been trying to avoid. Alternatively, the insurgency might greatly weaken Russian forces. The Ukrainian insurgent army could impose heavy damages on Russian forces and erode Putin’s position among Russian elites, on whose support he depends for power. Ukrainian forces would have major incentives to take their fight inside Russian territory, attacking Russia’s rearguard in Belarus and Russia itself. There are possible other paths toward further escalation, but they all eventually lead toward the nuclear threshold. Scores of war games carried out by the United States and its allies in the wake of Russia’s 2014 invasion of Ukraine make it clear that Putin would probably use a nuclear weapon if he concludes that his regime is threatened. It is hard to know exactly what turn of events would scare him enough to cross the nuclear threshold. Certainly a large Nato army entering Russian territory would be enough. But what if events in Ukraine loosened his grip on power at home? Indeed, achieving regime change in Russia indirectly by making Putin lose in Ukraine seems to be the logic behind some of those who are pushing for escalation today. Moving across the nuclear threshold wouldn’t necessarily mean an immediate, full-force nuclear exchange – in other words, global thermonuclear war. But it would be an extremely dangerous, watershed event in world history. The nuclear option that has been most frequently discussed in the past few days involves Russia using a small nuclear weapon (a “non-strategic nuclear weapon”) against a specific military target in Ukraine. Such a strike might have a military purpose, such as destroying an airfield or other military target, but it would mainly be aimed at demonstrating the will to use nuclear weapons, or “escalating to de-escalate”, and scaring the west into backing down. Some analysts have questioned Russia’s ability to actually carry out such an operation, given its lack of practice. Unfortunately, this isn’t the only or even the most likely option available to the Kremlin. Based on war games I ran in the wake of Putin’s 2014 invasion, a more likely option would be a sudden nuclear test or a high-altitude nuclear detonation that damages the electrical grid over a major Ukrainian or even Nato city. Think of an explosion that makes the lights go out over Oslo. Those war games indicated that the best US response to this kind of attack would be first to demonstrate US resolve with a response in kind, aimed at a target of similar value, followed by restraint and diplomatic efforts to de-escalate. In most games, Russia still responds with a second nuclear attack, but in the games that go “well”, the United States and Russia manage to de-escalate after that, although only in circumstances where both sides have clear political off-ramps and lines of communication between Moscow and Washington have remained open. In all the other games, the world is basically destroyed. Even in the better case where both sides take their fingers off the triggers, the nuclear taboo has been broken, and we are in an entirely new era: two nuclear superpowers have used their nuclear weapons in a war. The proliferation consequences alone would be far-reaching, as other countries accelerate their nuclear weapons programs. The very fact that the nuclear taboo had been broken increases the odds that the nuclear threshold is crossed again in future conflicts, not just between Russia and America, but also with China, between India and Pakistan, in the Middle East, or elsewhere. Even this outcome in which the world is “saved”, the United States is far worse off than it was before the war in Ukraine broke out last month.  What is the alternative? Once again, infinite scenarios and branches are possible, but there is a single basic one that helps to simplify thinking. It begins with an effort to avoid further escalation today. So far, the Biden administration has wisely restrained direct US military involvement in the conflict, but holding off against the rising chorus of voices pushing for escalation may be hard in the coming days if Russian forces brutally devastate Ukraine’s cities. But the most difficult challenge lies a little further down the road with the scenario described above: how to respond if Russia imposes a puppet regime in Ukraine. This would put the United States in the near-impossible position of having to choose between further escalation and compromising on the very principles that drove it toward the war in the first place – the right of a nation like Ukraine to be free and independent of subjugation to foreign rule. In this scenario, the Biden administration would have to show extraordinary leadership and strength to hold together its coalition and steer it toward restraint. It would face extremely high levels of pressure from European capitals, Ukrainian lobbies, and others to reject the puppet government and fight on, perhaps by recognizing a Ukrainian government-in-exile. The administration is already facing calls from hawkish corners of Washington to pre-empt any negotiated settlement to this war. Emotions are likely to have a much greater effect on the free democracies fighting for Ukraine than on the autocrat sitting in the Kremlin, but they will affect both sides. As they escalate, the prospects of negotiation diminish further. Would Nato’s door remain open to a Russian-dominated Ukraine? Probably, but it would be similar to claiming that Nato’s door is open to North Korea or Iran (which it theoretically is). All of the consequences that are likely from this conflict – growing conventional force buildup on the Nato-Russia border, higher levels of defense spending in the United States at the expense of domestic programs, an end to efforts to draw down US military posture in the Middle East, and fewer resources for strategic competition with China – would still be a better outcome than the alternative, in which nuclear weapons have been used. Wars can start quickly or slowly, but it is a dictum of strategy that once started, they take on a logic of their own. It is not too soon to think about how to bring this war to a close. The chances that Putin emerges strategically weak are real. But that does not mean the US can win. It will have to settle for a picture that is much uglier than it was before the war, and the sooner Washington accepts that, the better.

On the contrary, you can take a city but you can’t take the hearts and minds of its people and Ukrainians are demonstrating that every single day.” “We’ve already seen that Russia has failed in its chief objectives,” he added. “It’s not been able to hold Ukraine. It’s not going to be able to hold Ukraine in the long term.” Blinken said that Putin “has a clear plan to brutalise Ukraine, but to what end? He is now turning to a strategy of laying waste” Ukrainian cities. He warned that if even if Putin succeeded in installing a puppet regime in the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, Ukrainians would never acquiesce. “I think it’s pretty evident that they will never accept that,” he said. Blinken also tried to explain the fiasco on Tuesday surrounding the plan to deliver Polish MiG-29 fighter jets to Ukraine. The US had previously given a green light to Poland to supply the planes to Ukraine, saying it would replace them by providing more modern US fighter jets to the Polish air force. On Tuesday, Poland announced it would hand all its MiG-29s to the US at the Ramstein airbase in Germany, taking Washington by surprise. Within hours the Pentagon said the plan was not tenable. “I think what we’re seeing is that Poland’s proposal shows that there are some complexities that the issue presents when it comes to providing security assistance. We have to make sure that we’re doing it in the right way,” Blinken said. The Russian defence ministry has said that any country that provided bases from which Ukrainian war planes took off from to attack Russian forces would be considered as being involved in the conflict. “Departing from a US Nato base in Germany to fly into airspace contested with Russia over Ukraine raises some serious concerns for the entire Nato alliance,” Blinken said. “So we have to work through the specifics of these things going forward. It’s simply not clear to us that there’s a substantive rationale for doing it in the way that was put forward yesterday.” Both Blinken and Truss were questioned about the Ukrainian demands to establish no-fly zones over Ukraine, or at least over humanitarian corridors inside the country. Both ruled it out. “The reality is that setting up a no-fly zone would lead to a direct confrontation between Nato and Russia, and that is not what we are looking at,” Truss said, and pointed out the announcement on Wednesday that the UK would supply the Ukrainian armed forces with the Starstreak anti-aircraft system. “What we are looking at is making sure that the Ukrainians are able to defend their own country with the best possible selection of anti-tank weapons and anti-[aircraft] systems.” Blinken said: “If I were in President Zelenskiy’s position, I’m sure I would be asking for everything possible, in his mind, to help the Ukrainian people. But he added: “Both of our countries and so many others, have done extraordinary things to make sure that the Ukrainians have in their hands the means to effectively defend themselves against this war of choice from Russia.”",,,,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3cf305d67c45e942991c676e4d61c127acee8a30/0_50_6048_3628/master/6048.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=c4ab149f765a2a20c9a97685485e68ce

It also raises questions about how far European countries are prepared to escalate militarily before they believe they will touch a dangerous Russian tripwire. The US and Europe have worked hard to keep their differences over sanctions and oil embargos to a public minimum, and tried to accommodate each other’s national interests. So it was striking on Tuesday when first the Pentagon described a Polish offer to send planes to the US airbase in Ramstein as “untenable”, and then the deputy US secretary of state said the US had not been consulted about the plan.  Part of the problem was that the Polish proposal was subtly but critically different to a scheme that had previously been discussed in private. Against the backdrop of highly charged diplomatic tensions, presentation matters. In essence, Poland said it would cooperate in strengthening the Ukrainian air force so long as this would be seen in Moscow as a US, Nato or EU scheme but not a Polish one. In its original, US-conceived iteration, the proposal was a trilateral deal whereby Poland would hand over the MiGs to Ukrainian pilots to fly into their homeland, and the US would then provide some substitute planes. Boris Johnson, an enthusiast, described the plan as “rent a MiG”. That proposal, arguably, was not qualitatively different to Nato members providing Ukraine with Javelin anti-tank missiles. In return, Poland would eventually fill the hole in its air force with 28 F-16s being provided by the US. But under private pressure from the US, Poland felt the plan unduly exposed its citizens to Putin’s ire. So instead, in a game of diplomatic pass the parcel, Poland tweaked the proposals so the planes would be sent free of charge to the US airbase in Ramstein, Germany, rather than being flown out of Poland into Ukraine. The move would literally take Poland out of the line of Russia’s fire since the plan could be labelled as that of the US, Nato or the EU. US dismisses Polish plan to provide fighter jets to be sent to UkraineRead more Poland also suggested other frontline Nato countries with MiG planes should match its plan, a proposal directed at Slovakia and Romania. If executed it would mean Ukraine had 70 extra planes at its disposal. The Pentagon’s response – “it is simply not clear to us that there is a tangible justification for this” – was swift. Passing the parcel back, it said any decision to hand over planes ultimately rested with the Polish government, although it did not kill off the proposal altogether. It is possible that Poland’s nationalist government launched its plan with the aim of relieving pressure from the US Congress and the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, knowing full well it would be rejected. Either way the public spat is a setback. Over the weekend the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, had said a plan involving planes was under active consideration. The upshot after this mini-debacle is Russia retains air superiority. Ukrainian pilots who were being trained in Poland to fly the planes are now grounded with no machines with which to defend their country. An opportunity has been squandered. The episode may have lessons for both sides. The possibility of making the MiG-29s available first appeared publicly on 27 February, when the EU made the unprecedented decision to provide military aid to a country outside the bloc. The first tranche of equipment for Ukraine is expected to amount to €500m (£417m), but up to €5bn is to be spent under the European Peace Initiative. It was then that the head of EU diplomacy, Josep Borrell, said that aid for Kyiv would also include offensive weapons, including planes. At that point it became clear that the planes would only be MIG-29 and Su-25, because Ukrainian pilots only have experience with these machines. Poland, it would seem, did not appreciate the issue being disclosed. However, the country has emerged strengthened in another way from the past 24 hours. The US has provided Poland with two Patriot defence missile batteries. Each battery consists of two firing platoons with two launchers. This means there will be 16 launchers in Poland. They can have either four or six missiles. The latest Pac-3 MSE missiles are capable of shooting down the Russian Iskander ballistic and manoeuvring missiles. Unfortunately, they are also the anti-aircraft defence that Ukraine lacks.

It’s a concept Egle Plytnikaite, a Lithuanian illustrator based in Vilnius, has captured poignantly in her cover art for this week’s edition of the Guardian’s weekly news magazine. “My goal was to depict the unbreakable spirit of Ukrainian people who united for their country in the darkest hour,” she writes. “They are experiencing an absolutely horrible and inhumane terror from Russian occupiers and yet they manage to keep morale high and fight back with incredible force. There is a saying that ‘you cannot make a free man kneel’ and Ukrainians are a living example of that.  “Slava Ukraini, heroyam slava!” (Glory to Ukraine, glory to the heroes) For many people, the true horror of Vladimir Putin’s assault on Ukraine was brought home last weekend by shocking images showing a family of four killed by Russian mortar fire while fleeing the town of Irpin. Yet, despite the dire conditions for civilians trapped in cities such as Kherson and Mariupol, determination to resist the Russian invasion stayed firm. Indeed, in refusing to leave Kyiv, Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has epitomised courage and dignity in the face of Moscow’s onslaught. Our coverage in this edition focuses on the Ukrainian resistance, with Luke Harding reflecting on a week that felt as though decades had gone by. The diary of a Kyiv parent details a world turned upside down in a few days. Captured Russian soldiers express confusion and regret while, on Ukraine’s borders, a mass exodus continues, with about 2 million people having fled. Most have headed for Poland where, as Lorenzo Tondo observes, they have received a different welcome to the Syrian and Afghan refugees who arrived there last year. In Opinion, Neal Ascherson laments history’s forgotten lessons, Larry Elliott ponders the west’s appetite for sustained sanctions against Russia, and Rebecca Solnit reminds us that in a world beset by chaos and turmoil, hope can always be found if you know where to look.

That was the image the then Spanish prime minister, Félipe González, used to depict the night the Berlin Wall fell. Since 24 February, when history stormed out of the stables, we have again been living in such a moment. Will we be able to bridle it again? With the invasion of Ukraine the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, has thrown himself into the unthinkable. He has crossed the Rubicon into a time of war. He has no way back. Fire and flames, all or nothing. Political will and cool-headedness on our side are now of vital importance. The first is present in abundance, but the latter is in short supply.  In times of great danger, unexpected forces are unleashed. Ukraine is fighting back, and in the opening battle for European public opinion it has achieved a stunning victory. We are no longer looking at a chaotic country on the Black Sea but a nation presenting itself as the bearer of Europe’s democratic promise, with the president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, its hero. At least as unexpected is Germany’s geopolitical awakening. Massive defence investments, military support for Kyiv, the recognition of gas dependency as a strategic error: one surprise follows another. Germany’s chancellor, Olaf Scholz, spoke in the Bundestag of a “zeitenwende” (historical turning point) for Europe, and took his parliament and public with him into that new era. It’s how Helmut Kohl seized the moment in November 1989. Three weeks after the fall of the Berlin Wall he single-handedly launched plans for German unification in that same Bundestag, astonishing friend and foe alike. This spectacular second German wende gives the whole EU more unity and strength. Now that Berlin is no longer applying the brakes, Europe is suddenly deploying the power of its economic sanctions with full force. It is also striking that the EU will be delivering weapons worth €450m to Kyiv, something that would have been taboo until 10 days ago. To the EU, this feels like crossing a Rubicon of its own. The European alliance for peace is now a party in a conflict with a military and nuclear superpower. The impact of Germany’s awakening is more far-reaching still. As long as Europe’s most powerful country remained militarily reluctant, Europe could not be strong. Now that Germany is accepting the realities of international power politics, a lot can change. France, which has always pushed for a more geopolitical Europe, will feel less alone. Other defence-spending laggards such as the Netherlands and Italy will no longer be able to hide behind Germany’s back. These events also empower Poland and the other central and eastern European member states. For years, their warnings against Russia were considered exaggerations in Europe’s capitals of the west and the south (except, perhaps, London). This has now changed. Just weeks ago, Poland was in the EU dock for offending against the rule of law. Today, peace and security trump such worries. But at a moment when Europe is fighting in the name of democratic freedoms, it should not lower its guard internally either. Europe shows plenty of political energy, but strategic calm is sometimes lacking – which is worrying. Twitter triumphalism about Russian military miscalculation is premature. Keeping heads cool is now a matter of life and death. The absolute priority is to avert the danger of a nuclear war. Bravely insisting that Putin is bluffing when he threatens one is irresponsible. But that fact does not seem to have got through to all the leading politicians. On the very day the weapons deliveries were announced, the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, rashly put the prospect of EU membership for Ukraine on the table. The next day, Zelenskiy submitted an official request. Poland and other eastern European countries cheered in response, and the European parliament applauded. Hesitant member states kept quiet or took a nuanced position for the time being; nobody begrudges the beleaguered Ukrainians a ray of hope. In the recklessness of the zeitenwende, Von der Leyen appears to ignore the fact that for the Kremlin, which we are trying to bring to its senses, Nato’s and the EU’s promises to Kyiv since 2008 and 2014 are primary sources of conflict. Is this the best moment to feed the distrust of an opponent in full rage, and to add complexity to a situation already filled with dangerous ambiguities? Amid such high tension, diplomatic formulas of “long-term perspective” or “perhaps one day” are counterproductive. It is tragic but, at best, such statements have come too early. At worst, they will be another false promise. The upcoming EU summit in Versailles on 10-11 March would then repeat for the EU what the infamous Bucharest summit in April 2008 did for Nato: open a door to aspiring members while knowing very well they will never cross it in one piece. And how are we to envisage the outcome: the former Soviet Republic Ukraine joining the EU without becoming a Nato member at the same time? The latter is a geopolitical red line, since it would risk a nuclear war between the US and Russia. But without the US, can the EU rescue Ukraine from Moscow’s clutches based on its own military assistance clause (article 42(7) of the Treaty of Lisbon), the untested counterpart to the Nato treaty’s article 5, which says an attack on one is an attack on all? Unsurprisingly, Georgia and Moldova, two other countries eager to escape Moscow’s grip, followed suit within days in seeking EU membership. During the big EU eastward enlargement after the end of the cold war, Poland and the other new members entered Nato first. There was a gap of five years for some (like Poland), just a matter of weeks for others (like Slovenia), but the nuclear-security guarantee always came before the EU acquis – and not without reason. It is true that Finland and Sweden are in the EU but outside Nato (as are Austria, Ireland, Malta and Cyprus), but those states were neutral in the cold war, and not behind the iron curtain. Faced with the Russian threat, Finland and Sweden may now want to join. For the EU it might be more urgent to diminish the strategic ambiguity for these two current members by somehow extending Nato’s nuclear umbrella to them, rather than dangerously increasing it for all. To the beleagured aspirants, there are other ways to offer economic support and a prospect of rapprochement. The example of Ukrainian EU membership shows that even this war has not freed Europe of its inbuilt strategic insouciance. Thinking in terms of power, interests and identity, in terms of history and geography, is at odds with Brussels’ traditional self-image as a neutral and open space. The EU, after all, was built to overcome power politics, to tear down borders and walls, to disarm national rivalries. Its 1950s founders saw their community as the vanguard of world peace – not a player jostling with the rest but a moral beacon speaking the language of values, at once affable and haughty. This vocation was strengthened after 1989: Europe was the end of history. Now that history is brutally back, it will take time to amend these deficiencies and inbuilt blind spots. Simply calling for a “geopolitical commission” (as Von der Leyen has done) or for more “European sovereignty” (language that made it into the German coalition agreement) is insufficient.

In this moment of crisis, opening the door to Ukraine is one thing the EU can do | Timothy Garton AshRead more If Europe is to act as a power among powers, capable at some stage even of commanding destructive military force, it will need a different political language to speak about its place in the world. As Hans Kribbe writes in his book The Strongmen, the EU will need to change its ethos and demeanour. In sum, it should no longer be the angel battling to liberate the continent and the world from evil and tyranny, but a mortal, more strategic and real-political actor, which also understands the limits of its powers and its own time. In Versailles this week, EU leaders will discuss these matters. In the weeks ahead, one question will be: can we accept coexistence with a geopolitical adversary whom we despise, be it in Moscow or Beijing? Not crushing them as the devil incarnate, not trying to destroy them, not projecting ourselves (again) into a post-historical future of universal peace, but dealing with them as a rival?

They also called for the EU and Nato to speed up their approach to applications for membership from Balkans countries, and bolster defences against Russian interference.  Kosovo’s prime minister, Albin Kurti, warned that “it is in the interest of the Russian Federation to have new battlegrounds because they do not want to go back to peace”. The country’s president, Vjosa Osmani, predicted that “Russia, by destabilising the western Balkans, will seek to destabilise the whole of the Europe” and said Moscow was using Serbia to endanger democratic values. Šefik Džaferović, the Bosniak (Bosnian Muslim) member of Bosnia-Herzegovina’s tripartite presidency, warned that his country was particularly vulnerable to Russian meddling, as Milorad Dodik, the Serb member of the presidency who has close links to the Kremlin, is threatening to withdraw Bosnian Serb participation from the national army, judiciary and taxation system – in effect ripping up the Dayton peace treaty that ended the war in 1995. “Dodik is trying to take advantage of the fact that the attention of the west is focused on Ukraine,” Džaferović told the Guardian. “He is encouraged in his behaviour by Russia, which is always keen on showing that it can destabilise the soft underbelly of the EU and Nato. Western governments should consider this much more seriously and engage more actively and strongly in Bosnia-Herzegovina and the whole region.” “These are dark days for Europe and the whole world. We are witnessing something that is horrible. We saw a similar horror here in Bosnia-Herzegovina in the 1990s,” Džaferović said. Osmani said the appeasement of autocrats such as Vladimir Putin and the Serbian president, Alexsandar Vučić, had been shown not to work in Ukraine. She warned: “Russia is likely to use either the Baltics or the western Balkans – or both – to raise tensions and expand the crisis internationally.” Kurti said: “I fear that the longer the war lasts in Ukraine, the greater the chances of spillover in the western Balkans. And that is because it is in the interest of the Russian Federation to have new battlegrounds.” “Putin still considers Nato intervention in Kosovo as the most important recent international single event,” Kurti said. “He wants the state of Kosovo to fail in order to show that Nato success was temporary, just like in Iraq and Afghanistan.” Their remarks came as the German foreign minister, Annalena Baerbock, started a tour of the western Balkans including Kosovo and Serbia, saying she was determined to send a message that Europe was not going to let the region fall under the influence of Russia. Albania, North Macedonia and Montenegro, already Nato members, have all redoubled their calls for serious progress to be made on stalled applications to join the EU. Kosovo is also applying to join the Council of Europe – from which Russia is resigning. Osmani said: “Everything we see in Ukraine brings back memories of the heavy price we had to pay to achieve our freedom. So we may be a small country, but we hope we have a big voice to say there is no price too high to defend democracy.” Kurti and Osmani, members of different parties but partners in government, face a particular hurdle, since five EU countries have yet to recognise Kosovo. Kosovo declared its independence in 2008, nearly a decade after a bloody liberation struggle that saw the Nato air force bomb Belgrade as the alliance came close to a direct confrontation with Russia – something it has not been prepared to do in Ukraine. Serbia, itself an aspirant to EU membership, is performing a delicate balancing act between its European aspirations and close cultural and political ties with Russia. Earlier this month, thousands of people waved Russian flags and pictures of Putin at a pro-Moscow demonstration after the invasion of Ukraine. Vučić has repeatedly pointed out that the country voted against Russia in the recent key vote at the UN general assembly, rather than support it. Osmani pointed out: “Belgrade is the only place in Europe with pro-Putin protests, with politicians saying they support the aggression. They are the only country in Europe that has not aligned itself with EU sanctions. Quite the opposite – they have increased the number of flights from Belgrade to Russia.” Kurti said: “Neutrality is siding with the aggressor. It is the most indecent thing you can do. You cannot be neutral between fire and firefighter.” This article was amended on 11 March 2022.

The warning from the deputy foreign minister, Sergei Ryabkov, came as supporters of Ukraine, including the UK, Germany and the United States, have been urgently shipping thousands of anti-tank and anti-aircraft missiles to Kyiv in response to Moscow’s aggression.  Ryabkov said that Russia had “warned the US that pumping weapons from a number of countries it orchestrates isn’t just a dangerous move, it’s an action that makes those convoys legitimate targets”. Russian ground invasion Volodymyr Zelenskiy, the Ukrainian president, disclosed that at least 1,300 of his country’s troops have been killed in the conflict so far in the first estimate of Ukraine’s combat losses after almost three weeks of fighting. Ukraine has claimed to have killed some 12,000 Russian troops. Heavy fighting continued across Ukraine. The French president Emmanuel Macron and German chancellor Olaf Scholz reported that Vladimir Putin showed no willingness to end the war after a phone call between the leaders in which they renewed a call for a ceasefire and negotiations. A statement from the office of the French president described the conversation with the Russian leader as “very frank and also difficult”.

Photograph: Evgeniy Maloletka/AP Russian forces continued to pulverise the besieged port city of Mariupol, shelling a mosque sheltering more than 80 people, including children, the Ukrainian government said on Saturday, while fighting also raged on the outskirts of Kyiv. In several areas around the capital artillery barrages sent residents scurrying for shelter and air raid sirens wailed. Britain’s Ministry of Defence said that Russian ground forces massed north of Kyiv had now edged to within 15 miles of the city centre as their attempt to encircle it ground on. Columns of smoke were seen rising over the southwest of the city after a strike on an ammunition depot in the town of Vasylkiv. In the south, Ukraine’s military said that Russian forces captured Mariupol’s eastern outskirts, tightening the armed squeeze on the strategic port. Taking Mariupol and other ports on the Azov Sea could allow Russia to establish a land corridor to Crimea, which it seized from Ukraine in 2014. Zelenskiy encouraged his people to keep up their resistance, which many analysts said has prevented the rapid offensive and military victory the Kremlin had expected. “The fact that the whole Ukrainian people resist these invaders has already gone down in history, but we do not have the right to let up our defence, no matter how difficult it may be for us,” he said.

Photograph: Reuters He accused Russia of employing “a new stage of terror” with the apparent kidnapping of the mayor of Melitopol, Ivan Fedorov, who was last seen being led away from his office on Friday by armed men, prompting a demonstration in the city. Zelenskiy added that Russia would need to carpet-bomb the Ukrainian capital and kill its residents to take the city. “They will come here only if they kill us all,” he said. “If that is their goal, let them come.” In a bleak coda that spoke of the continuing levels of destruction, Zelenskiy added that some small Ukrainian towns had ceased to exist. Despite crippling economic sanctions imposed on Moscow and international isolation, Putin – who has imposed his own draconian crackdown on media freedom and free speech in Russia – has given no indication of being swayed to end the war. In his 90-minute call with Macron and Scholz on Saturday, Putin spoke about “issues related to agreements under discussion to implement the Russian demands” for ending the war, the Kremlin said without providing details. Among other things, the Kremlin has previously demanded a promise by Nato never to accept Ukraine as a member and for the alliance to pull back from countries such as Poland, Romania and Bulgaria.

The governor of the Kyiv region Oleksiy Kuleba said fighting and threats of Russian air attacks were continuing yesterday morning but later said some evacuations were proceeding. “We will try to get people out every day, as long as it’s possible to observe a ceasefire,” he said. The governor of the Russian-controlled territory of Donetsk said constant shelling was complicating bringing aid into Mariupol. “There are reports of looting and violent confrontations among civilians over what little basic supplies remain in the city,” the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said. “Medicines for life-threatening illnesses are quickly running out, hospitals are only partially functioning, and the food and water are in short supply.” People were boiling ground water for drinking, using wood to cook food and burying dead bodies near where they lay, a staff member for the international group Médecins Sans Frontières in the city said. “We saw people who died because of lack of medication,” he said, adding that many people had also been wounded or killed. “Neighbours just dig a hole in the ground and put the dead bodies inside.”",,,,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2aa20649429b0de686244c62ee88b14e12a0370d/0_48_2976_1786/master/2976.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=1303e1759e0669a3c8fc6379d0fe2acc

Not only can Russian forces strike the western limits of Ukraine, killing at least 35 people near where western arms will be crossing into the country, but the Kremlin does not care if US or other volunteer fighters were training there.  A day earlier, Russia’s deputy foreign minister, Sergei Ryabkov had said its military would treat arms shipments to Ukraine from Nato countries as “legitimate targets”. West plans to arm resistance if Russian forces occupy UkraineRead more The facility, well known as a location where Nato forces trained Ukrainians in years before the war began, is near the most direct route between Rzeszow airport, where western arms are being flown in, and the city of Lviv. It is a place where foreign volunteers are said to have congregated as they start training with Ukraine’s armed forces. But even if the base is not used or heavily used for either purpose, it is a site long viewed with suspicion by Russia. Yet there are important limits to the Russian attack. While the proximity of lethal missile strikes to Nato borders may appear unnerving, the US and other allies have taken steps to reinforce and protect Poland’s air defences. The US vice-president, Kamala Harris, announced at the end of last week that two US Patriot missile batteries had been moved into Poland, stationed at Rzeszow. British military sources say a companion, the medium-range Sky Sabre system, already in the country after recent exercises, may be positioned alongside them soon. Despite Rybakov’s rhetoric, a direct Russian attack on a Nato country, with its defences recently reinforced, would be unlikely in any circumstances, but particularly so given how Moscow’s forces are struggling, losing men and materiel in their attack on Ukraine. 00:53'We crossed the checkpoint and they started shooting,' says journalist wounded in Irpin – video Nevertheless, the presence of the Patriot batteries is designed to reassure that it will be possible to intercept any stray missiles entering Polish airspace as the Russian offensive against Ukraine gets closer to the west of the country. Romania, another Nato country bordering Ukraine, already has its own Patriot system, while Germany and the Netherlands said a few days ago they would reposition one of their own in another border country, Slovakia. As for the supply of western arms to Ukraine, experts believe it is unlikely to be constrained by a single attack, even one as deadly as that of Sunday morning. The Polish-Ukrainian border is more than 300 miles long, and steps are being taken to conceal the vital supplies as they cross into the country and beyond. It is not realistically possible to cut off or interdict the movement of arms with periodic airstrikes because the territory is too vast. To do so is only practical where Moscow’s forces dominate an area. For now, Russian ground troops, focused on Kyiv and the cities of east, are a long way from Lviv and the western border. Nick Reynolds, a land warfare specialist at the Rusi thinktank, said: “[Vladimir] Putin will struggle to interdict supplies into western Ukraine, but stands a much better chance of eventually encircling and thus cutting off Kyiv, as well as potentially cutting off crossings along the Dnieper River. But this will take time.” Russia’s dominance of the skies, particularly at night, will mean it is likely to engage in more missile attacks and show again it can strike in the west. But these do not in themselves dramatically alter the balance of the war, which is already deadly enough.",,,,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c1d44979e7aa07f107a53f613756169a49fe42b1/0_200_6001_3601/master/6001.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=41385e459c7ccef2ca79832f6210ba8f

The west must stop him before this contagion spreads,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/mar/13/toxic-putin-is-going-for-bust-the-west-must-stop-him-before-this-contagion-spreads,"Politically speaking, Vladimir Putin is a dead man walking. As dictators always do, he has fatally over-reached. Bunker-bound and bonkers, there’s no way back into the world for him. At home, too, he looks increasingly isolated. But, militarily speaking, he’s not giving up. In Ukraine, the toxic president is going for bust. The worrying question: what will he do next?  Insofar as Putin still has a plan, it is to bomb and batter the Ukrainian people into submission, by whatever means necessary, as quickly as possible. If that requires using chemical weapons, such as chlorine gas, as in Syria, who can doubt he will do so. Last week’s Mariupol maternity hospital war crime was a harbinger of worse, perhaps far worse, to come. Diplomats and analysts believe that, despite Ukraine’s unexpectedly effective resistance, Russia’s grip on the country is inexorably tightening. Vitali Klitschko, mayor of Kyiv, says the capital only has sufficient supplies for one or two weeks if attacked. Half the population has fled. If the allied powers sincerely want Ukraine to survive, time is running out. The west must now maximise pressure on Putin – military as well as economic – as a matter of utmost urgency. Ukraine’s citizens and soldiers cannot be expected to hold out for very much longer without increased, all-round support. Ukraine’s future as an independent democratic state may be decided in the coming fortnight. So, too, may be the future of Putinism in Russia itself. President Putin is going for bust in Ukraine, trying to bomb the country into submission. Photograph: Alexei Nikolsky/TASS The oppressive, corrupt regime in Moscow that has blighted Russian lives for over 20 years, and spread fear and discord around the world, has never been weaker. This is a huge moment. Europe’s future security architecture could indeed be remodelled, as Russia has often urged, but on a post-Putin basis of cooperative, lawful, democratic co-existence, not a balance of terror. This tantalising prospect is offset by the risk of all-out conflict with a nuclear-armed tyrant who, hemmed in by his own miscalculations, may lash out wildly. Nato’s ill-judged refusal to provide any form of no-fly zone, as requested by Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, or for example to create a UN-mandated safe zone on the ground in western Ukraine, stems from such fears. So what will Putin do? Three main scenarios are in view: a compromise peace deal; a stalemate; or a wider, escalating war. After two weeks of fighting, there is much talk of talks but no actual peace process. Dashing hopes it might intervene, China has kept its distance. Last week’s foreign ministers’ meeting in Turkey was a deliberate stalling exercise by Moscow. The two sides remain miles apart. Baltic region map Ukraine’s leaders will not agree to anything permanent while cities are besieged, vast swaths of their country are occupied, and heinous war crimes proliferate – and why should they? Nor is it likely that Putin will abandon his insistence that Ukraine remain separate from Nato and the EU, or give up his claims to Crimea and recently captured territory along the southern seaboard. Under a second scenario, the war drags on, degenerating into a Donbas-like stalemate or frozen conflict. This would suit no one. It would be disastrous for Ukraine’s citizens, both the displaced and those who remain; for Ukraine’s integrity as a nation state; for bogged-down, demoralised Russian forces facing determined insurgents; and for international relations and stability, endlessly polarised and poisoned by Ukraine-related tensions. Knowing this, and spurning peace, Putin is actively pursuing the third scenario: “doubling down” on military force, as CIA director William Burns put it last week, encircling cities, using hungry, freezing civilians as hostages, seizing more territory, and threatening a wider war, potentially involving chemical or even battlefield nuclear weapons. Here is the crux of the west’s dilemma. The US and UK are pumping increasingly advanced weaponry into Ukraine on a vast scale. British anti-tank missiles, for example, are reportedly proving grimly lethal. Now Starstreak anti-aircraft weapons are also being deployed, ostensibly for “defensive”, not “offensive”, purposes. Such sophistry aside, there can be no doubting where this massive Berlin airlift-type build-up is leading. Nato’s rejection of a no-fly zone and the US veto on supplying Polish MiG fighters to Ukraine’s air force cannot disguise the reality that the allies, de facto, are already party to this conflict or, in legal parlance, are “co-combatants”. Russian bombing of maternity hospital ‘genocide’, says ZelenskiyRead more Putin characterises sanctions as western economic warfare. How much longer before he declares that Russia is also under western military attack, and escalates accordingly? That’s the firm expectation in the Baltic republics – Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania – frontline former Soviet republics that Putin regards, like Ukraine, as not “real” countries. The Russian enclave of Kaliningrad is another looming flashpoint. Valdis Dombrovskis, a former Latvian prime minister, warned last week the Baltic states may be next in the firing line. “If we do not support Ukraine, it’s not going to stop in Ukraine… Unfortunately, it is likely this aggression will continue in other countries,” he said. Discussing Putin’s veiled nuclear threat, Dombrovskis, an EU commission vice-president, said the west must not be intimidated. “The question is, to what extent we are giving in to this blackmail because it can be used all the time against everything. Putin will continue his aggressive wars, he will always use this blackmail.” Plainly, there is no risk-free path through this horror. But any outcome that destroys a European democracy, or rewards Russian aggression, is unsustainable in the long term. That will only guarantee more grief down the road. Logically, practically, morally, the west really has no choice. Its leaders must now employ all possible levers – including the threat of direct military action – to stop Russia in its tracks in Ukraine, stop the mass murder of civilians, and stop the spread of the deadly Putin contagion.",,,,

But what if supplying them could prove catastrophic?",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/mar/14/ukraine-weapons-backfire-nato,"The United States and some of its Nato allies – Britain, Poland and the Baltic trio – have been the most vigorous in insisting that Ukraine must, for moral and strategic reasons, receive the weapons it needs to fight Russian aggression. The moral case, strengthened by Ukrainians’ valiant resistance and President Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s Churchillian wartime leadership, is that Ukraine is the victim, Russia the aggressor.  Ultimately, even Germany, which had been reluctant to arm Ukraine, was persuaded by this portrayal. It sent Ukraine 1,000 anti-tank and 500 anti-aircraft missiles and changed its policy prohibiting other members of the alliance from transferring German-made weapons to Ukraine. By now, Ukraine is receiving arms and equipment from many other countries, some of whom aren’t in Nato. The gist of the strategic case is that failing to resist aggression invites more of it. Poland and the Baltic states have a particularly strong stake in driving this point home, as a glance at a map of east-central Europe makes evident: if Ukraine comes under Russia’s sway, they will be vulnerable. The United States has been arming Ukraine and training its troops since 2015 and provided it $1.5bn in military support even before the war. With Ukraine now fighting for survival, there is strong, bipartisan support in Congress for extending even more help. On 11 March the Senate approved a spending bill, passed earlier by the House of Representatives, containing the $3.5bn in military aid for Ukraine requested by President Joe Biden. The White House had taken bold steps even earlier. Two days after the Russian invasion the president authorized $350m in emergency military assistance to Ukraine. By early March the US had arranged for 17,000 anti-tank missiles (including Javelins) to reach Poland and Romania for overland delivery to Ukraine. Confidence runs high that with more firepower Ukraine will, at minimum, blunt the Russian offensive and be in a strong position whenever the bargaining over the terms for ending the war begins. Those who believe this can point to compelling evidence: western training and weaponry have unquestionably helped Ukraine destroy a lot of Russian armor and aircraft. Hence their confidence that more Javelins will improve Ukraine’s ability to destroy Russia’s tanks, that additional Stinger anti-aircraft missiles will cause even more Russian warplanes to fall from the skies, and that counter-battery radars will locate and demolish deadly Russian artillery. Yet amid the moral outrage and depth of animosity toward Putin, the risks of pouring arms into Ukraine should be considered carefully and dispassionately. Providing Ukraine even more arms may well produce the results its proponents anticipate. It could, on the other hand, impel Russian commanders to subject Ukrainians to even greater pain. They have already experienced enormous suffering because Russia, as the Office of the United Nations Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) has noted, routinely hits civilian buildings. If the war becomes even more brutal, Ukraine may keep resisting, but then the number of Ukrainians seeking refuge in other countries, now 2.6 million (the largest proportion is in Poland), will soar. With Warsaw and Kraków, its two largest cities, overwhelmed by the influx, Poland has already appealed for help. A continuing exodus from Ukraine could strain the economies and social fabric of its neighbors, especially if the war drags on, preventing refugees from returning home. Furthermore, Russia may not stand by, allowing the west to fortify Ukraine’s army. Putin might order his generals to bomb the supply routes from Poland and Romania, the Nato countries that have the longest borders with Ukraine. On 11 March, after not having bombed them since 24 February, the day the war started, Russian aircraft took aim at military airfields in Lutsk and Ivano-Frankivsk in western Ukraine. Lutsk lies about 60 miles from Poland’s border, in Volyn province, which adjoins it. The city of Ivano-Frankivsk is located north of the Romania’s border, and the eponymous province of which it is part adjoins Romania. On 13 March, a barrage of Russian cruise missiles hit the Yavoriv military base, which is in Lviv province and less than 30 miles from the Polish border. These attacks are a signal from Putin that he won’t stand by while the west beefs up Ukraine’s army, which has already proved a tougher nut to crack than he anticipated, and were accompanied by the warning from the deputy foreign minister Sergei Ryabkov warning to the United States that Russia would regard arms “convoys” into Ukraine as “legitimate targets”. The United States and its allies may face unexpected countermoves from Russia and what they do in response could widen the war if Putin, in turn, raises the stakes. If the tit-for-tat spills over into Poland or Romania, whether intentionally or not, the stage could be set for a Nato-Russia confrontation, with nuclear weapons lurking in the background. Some experts are confident that arming Ukraine won’t widen the war, but if they’re wrong the consequences could prove catastrophic. And what if Ukraine starts losing? Will Nato cut its losses, thereby emboldening Putin? Or will it up the ante, risking a clash with Russia? None of these scenarios may materialize. Putin may prove prudent and risk averse. Then again, this war has shredded many assumptions that prevailed before it began.

But the United States and Nato allies refused for the same reasons they have been citing since Moscow invaded Ukraine on 24 February: that any attempt to establish a no-fly zone would place them in direct conflict with nuclear-armed Russia and spark a wider, more dangerous conflict.  Here is what you need to know about no-fly zones. What is a no-fly zone? It is a prohibition on all or certain types of aircraft flying through a designated airspace, over a country or region. Grisly urban warfare looms unless west beefs up Ukraine arms supplyRead more The zones require one or more parties to be willing to enforce them – that is, being ready and able to shoot down any aircraft violating the space. They have been used in attempts to limit an ongoing conflict on the ground and to protect certain populations. But they are costly, requiring constant air patrolling and monitoring. From 1991 to 2003 the US, France and Britain enforced no-fly zones over Iraq in the wake of the 1991 Gulf War, to protect Shia populations in the south and minority Kurds in the north from air attacks by the Saddam Hussein’s Sunni government. From 1993 to 1995 Nato enforced a UN-declared no-fly zone over Bosnia. And in 2011 Nato also enforced a UN-approved one over Libya during that country’s civil war. What would a no-fly zone achieve in Ukraine? A full no-fly zone enforced by Nato would mean that Russia’s superior air power could not be deployed against Ukrainians – but also that the Kyiv would not be able to fly its fighter jets and significantly effective attack drones against the Russians. It could allow civilians, who are becoming casualties at a staggering rate, to flee the conflict more safely. 01:47Zelenskiy urges Nato to impose no-fly zone over Ukraine – video Why not do it? US and Nato officials say flatly that for a Ukraine no-fly zone to work their own jets would have to be prepared to shoot down any Russian violators – effectively making them direct participants in the war. “If we did that, we’ll end up with something that could end in a full-fledged war in Europe, involving many more countries and causing much more human suffering. So that’s the reason why we make this painful decision,” Nato secretary general Jens Stoltenberg said on 4 March. A day later, Russian president Vladimir Putin confirmed those stakes, saying any country trying to enforce a Ukraine no-fly zone “will be considered by us as participation in an armed conflict by that country.” What about a ‘limited’ no-fly zone? Last week a group of US defence and foreign policy experts released a letter calling for a “limited” Nato-enforced no-fly zone over Ukraine to establish humanitarian corridors in which civilians were protected from aerial bombardment. But critics said that would not limit the risk of conflict with Russia, as Nato aircraft would still have to be willing to shoot down Russian aircraft. How much impact would one have? So far the war in Ukraine has not depended heavily on air power, on either side. In its invasion Russia has relied mostly on long-range missiles and surface artillery fire to attack Ukrainian targets. Fighting back, the Ukrainians have depended largely on ground fire. Yes, Ukraine urgently needs weapons. But what if supplying them backfires catastrophically? | Rajan MenonRead more A US defence official pointed to Russia’s missile attack on Sunday on a base in western Ukraine as an example. The Russians fired about two dozen cruise missiles from aircraft flying over Russian territory at the time. “A no-fly zone inside Ukraine would have had no effect on this particular set of strikes,” the official said Monday.

The FT had reported a “tentative” peace plan that included a ceasefire and Russian withdrawal if Kyiv declares neutrality and accepts limits on its armed forces.
The US president, Joe Biden, announced an extra $800m in security assistance from the US to Ukraine, to buy more weapons and military equipment, as part of a much larger package of aid.

In a televised speech to government ministers, Putin went further than before in acknowledging the pain that western sanctions were inflicting on the Russian economy, but insisted the country could withstand the blow.
There have been 43 attacks on Ukrainian healthcare facilities, infrastructure and workers since the beginning of the invasion, said WHO chief Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. Two health workers had been killed and at least 8 injured in the attacks, the WHO said.

I know that from my own family’s trauma",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/mar/18/bombs-rain-down-family-history-save-ukraine-putin-nato-eu,"Every time I look at the pictures of Mariupol or Kharkiv, I see a corner of Whitechapel in east London. I reacted the same way to images of Aleppo and, before that, Falluja and, before that, Grozny, because buildings crushed to rubble have a sad habit of looking the same. It brings back a memory – or rather something fainter: an inherited memory, one that was passed to me. Its origin is 27 March 1945; the 77th anniversary is a little over a week away. Early that morning, at 7.21am, a V2 rocket landed on Hughes Mansions, a block of flats on Vallance Road in the East End. It killed 134 people, more or less instantly. Among them were two sisters, Rivvi and Feige (pronounced fay-ghee). Feige Hocherman was 33 and she left behind two children, a son not yet 11 and a daughter aged eight and a quarter. The little girl was my mother, Sara.  The war was in its final weeks and the bomb that fell that morning would be the very last V2 to land on London. It wasn’t a targeted missile, though if it had been it could hardly have delighted its masters more. For of the 134 people killed by that Nazi rocket, 120 were Jews. It meant that, as a very young child, I somehow thought “Vallance Road” belonged alongside Belsen or Auschwitz in the small lexicon of words to be spoken only in whispers, each of them bywords for terror and grief. I was well into my 30s before I ever went close to that place. And yet, though I did not witness it and though I only ever saw the physical destruction that bomb wreaked through grainy archive photographs, I can honestly say that event shaped my life. Because it shaped my mother’s life. It made her who she was. There were the direct legacies, of course. For many decades, my mother was implacable in her anger towards the Germans, because it was a German rocket that had killed her mother. There would be no German products in our house; no German car. She was no less unbending on the necessity of Israel. For the Nazis, the identity of the victims of Hughes Mansions was no more than a lucky accident; but the fact remained that my mother had lost her mother to a Nazi operation that killed Jews en masse: she had felt the breath of the Shoah on her neck. Like many others, she would never lose the conviction that Jews would always need a place they could call their own and a means to defend themselves. The experience of such intense hurt so young had another, perhaps less predictable consequence: it opened up deep reservoirs of empathy for the suffering of others. “I feel your pain,” has become a joke phrase. But my mother really did feel your pain, even if you were someone she had only just met and whose life she had only glimpsed. 00:40New footage shows destroyed shopping centre in Mariupol  – video Why do I say all this now, nearly 80 years later? Because, as I look at the terrible destruction of Mariupol and the burning ruins of Kharkiv, I remember that the damage done by a rocket or artillery shell cannot be measured in the stark numbers of a death toll or, still less, the impact on infrastructure – though I saw this week that the cost of rebuilding Ukraine after Vladimir Putin has rained fire on that country is estimated at $100bn (£76bn) and it is rising every day. Instead the cost is measured in the aftershocks felt by those who survive the blast: the injured and the maimed, those whose homes are smashed, those children who once had a mother or father but who, in the briefest of moments, had them taken away by a bolt from the sky. That kind of bomb damage cannot be repaired with concrete. It lives on in the children of the dead, and in their children. I know, because it lives on in me. And yet the conclusion I draw from this is not the pacifist’s resolve that no bullet must ever be fired, no missile must ever be launched. For this, too, I learned from my mother: that while war is evil, the greater evil is murderous aggression that goes unchecked. No one would dare say “stop the war” to Volodymyr Zelenskiy and the people he leads, because that would be to demand that Ukrainians allow their children to keep being killed, their bodies tossed into mass graves at speed because it’s too dangerous to linger in the open, even when one of those bodies belongs to a six-year-old girl, buried in the pyjamas she wore when she was hit, patterned with cartoon unicorns. When a killer has his hands around your neck, choking the life out of you, what you need is the strength in your arms to get him off. This is what the Ukrainians are demanding the west give them. It is the right not to make war, but to repel aggression. It is the right to defend oneself against missiles that flatten an apartment building or destroy a theatre, whose basement shields up to 1,500 people, most of them old or very young. It is the right to protect a city where the last inhabitants melt snow to drink, and burn furniture to ward off the icy cold or cook what scraps of food they can find. Given that the west won’t do it, for fear of tangling with a nuclear state, Ukrainians want the equipment – above all the aircraft – to do it for themselves. It’s such an elemental need, and yet many struggle to comprehend it. There are plenty in western Europe and the US who took, or perhaps still take, a dim view of Nato, regarding it as a cold war throwback or an arm of western imperialism and militarism. But Ukrainians saw it differently: for them Nato was the body that might protect them from the neighbourhood bully who had already proved, just eight years ago, his determination to hurt them and take what was theirs. Most Ukrainians saw the European Union the same way. Those in Britain who so casually disdained our membership of the EU or Nato betray an unwitting but unappealing strain of privilege, akin to the trust fund millionaire who insists they never think about money. It’s easy to dismiss something precious when you have lots of it. That goes for individuals with wealth, but also for those countries or peoples who have only ever known the security of having a state of their own, whose borders are stable and where the notion of an enemy attack is all but unimaginable (or forgotten). My mother took none of those things for granted, and because she didn’t neither do I. In eight decades’ time, there will be Ukrainians in middle age who feel the same way, because of events happening right now. The reverberations will keep sounding, through the generations. That is why even short wars last so long. I am the son of that terrified little girl and I always will be. Jonathan Freedland is a Guardian columnist.

The Norwegian prime minister, Jonas Gahr Stoere, tweeted that the marines died on Friday night. The cause was under investigation but Norwegian police reported bad weather.  The marines, assigned to 2nd Marine Aircraft Wing, II Marine Expeditionary Force, were taking part in a Nato exercise called Cold Response. The US said the identities of the marines wouldn’t be immediately provided in keeping with defense department policy of notifying relatives first. The aircraft was an MV-22B Osprey with “a crew of four [which] was out on a training mission in Nordland county” in northern Norway, the Norwegian armed forces said. It was on its way north to Bodoe, where it was scheduled to land just before 6pm. The Osprey crashed in Graetaedalen in Beiarn, south of Bodoe. Police said a search and rescue mission was launched immediately. At 1.30am on Saturday, police arrived at the scene and confirmed that the crew of four had died. The annual Nato drills in Norway are unrelated to the war in Ukraine. This year they include about 30,000 troops, 220 aircraft and 50 vessels from 27 countries. Non-Nato members Finland and Sweden are also participating. The exercises began on 14 March and end on 1 April. The Norwegian armed forces said Cold Response “will carry on as planned, with the measures we have to take due to the weather”. A Norwegian rescue helicopter spotted the crash site late on Friday and local Red Cross crews were assigned to assist police on the ground, Norwegian media said. The Norwegian newspaper VG said Red Cross members drove close to the crash site with scooters and marked the trail with GPS for police in what they described as extremely difficult weather conditions. “It was a special night, it was a real storm. There were five of us driving towards the scene of the accident. There was one meter of visibility, snow and storm in the mountains,” Red Cross team leader Oerjan Kristensen told VG. “I guess it was a wind gust of 30-40 meters per second. When it blows like that, it is difficult to stand upright.” Kristensen added that the rescue operation was hampered by the risk of landslides in the mountains and the remoteness of the crash site. Police launched an investigation and accident commission members and police representatives were due to arrive at the crash site on Saturday. “The weather is very bad in the area to complete work at the scene but police will take it up again as soon as the weather conditions allow it,” operations manager Ivar Bo Nilsson from the Norland police district told reporters. Lt Gen Yngve Odlo, head of the Norwegian armed forces’ operational headquarters, said Cold Response would continue. “Right now there is full focus on ending the rescue operation, taking care of the people and then there will be a normal procedure with causation,” Odlo was quoted as saying by Norwegian public broadcaster NRK.

The west lacks a long-term strategy to defeat Putin",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/mar/20/joe-biden-putin-russia-ukraine-war,"What’s the plan, Joe? When he descends on Brussels this week for an emergency Nato summit, US president Joe Biden will proudly point to his big achievement during the Ukraine crisis: maintaining the unity of the alliance and keeping out of the war. Biden wants Russia to lose, to be seen to fail. But bold, decisive action to that end is lacking. The US approach is essentially reactive, tactical, detached. Is this really all that risk-averse American global leadership has to offer these days?  As Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, told Congress last week, weapons and sanctions are not enough. US fears of escalation are well understood in Kyiv. But its forces still need combat planes, aerial protection and safe humanitarian corridors. More than that, Ukraine’s people need effective, inspiring western leadership in support of the democratic ideals Biden champions. Their children are dying each day while Nato acts like a self-preservation society. They need a saviour. They need a plan. “You are the leader of your great nation. I wish you to be the leader of the world [which] means to be the leader of peace,” Zelenskiy told Biden in what sounded very much like a reproach. Republican senator Ben Sasse was more forthright. “They [Ukrainians] are fighting for the free world. We’re a superpower. We should act like it,” he said. Unfolding around Ukraine’s mass graves and blasted cities is a new “forever war” of the type Biden vowed to end. Judging by his latest comments, Vladimir Putin will not cease fire any time soon. Talking peace to him is like begging a butcher to turn vegetarian. Bloodbath upon atrocious bloodbath beckons. America’s president needs a strategy with open-ended options. First, he must stop naively assuring Putin that the allies will not intervene in any circumstances. Former UK prime minister Tony Blair, who knows a thing or two about invasions, gently chided him on this point last week. “Is it sensible to tell him [Putin] in advance that whatever he does militarily, we will rule out any form of military response?” It was a “strange tactic”, Blair wrote. Some British ministers reportedly share his concern. “Not provoking Putin” is the nearest the western powers have come to a mission statement. Yet the US alone is providing $2bn in military aid. British anti-tank weapons are exacting a grim toll. Russia is targeting western arms convoys, has bombed a staging post near the Polish border and twice sent military drones into neighbouring Nato states. Like it or not, mutual provocations are multiplying uncontrollably. Biden says Putin is a “war criminal”. So will he now seek his arrest? Will the US join the UN-backed International criminal court, where war crimes are tried? Don’t bet on it. By leaving Ukraine to fight alone, Biden risks confirming the long-held view on the European left that Nato is mostly about America’s forward defence, not enhancing Europe’s security or upholding international law. Jens Stoltenberg, Nato’s secretary general, would surely take exception to that claim. His focus is on defending Nato members and he’s doing a fantastic job. “Nato will not tolerate any attack on allied sovereignty,” he declared last week. Jens Stoltenberg, NATO secretary general, said last week: ‘Nato will not tolerate any attack on allied sovereignty’. Photograph: Action Press/REX/Shutterstock Fine. So what’s the plan, Jens? What about the slaughter next door? US-led Nato is not a purely defensive alliance. Nato forces fought in Afghanistan for 20 years. They bombed Serbia during the Kosovo conflict. A little more imagination in Washington and Brussels about what might be militarily possible, without triggering world war three, could go a long way in Ukraine. It’s unfair to blame weak US leadership alone. Nato has 30 member states, mostly European. Despite Biden’s talk of unprecedented unity, cracks are showing. East European countries, notably Poland and the three Baltic republics, want Nato and the EU to adopt a more robust military and sanctions posture. They also support Ukraine’s EU membership. Germany, Italy, Hungary, Greece and others are opposed. When the prime ministers of Poland, the Czech Republic and Slovenia travelled to Kyiv to meet Zelenskiy last week, Brussels hastened to make clear this was not an EU delegation, again for fear of provoking Putin. When Jarosław Kaczyński, the Polish leader, suggested an armed “peace mission” inside Ukraine, he was slapped down. So what’s the plan, Olaf? Chancellor Olaf Scholz of Germany, Europe’s most powerful country, has hugely increased national defence spending and suspended a Russian gas pipeline. But he rejects Ukraine’s call for an immediate, total energy embargo and is blocking or delaying additional sanctions. Zelenskiy lambasted Germany’s record last week, accusing it of prioritising economic interests over European security. These widening divisions could make for an explosive EU summit. It will take place alongside the Nato meeting this week. French president Emmanuel Macron is firmly in the German camp. The French oil giant TotalEnergies, for example, is conducting business as usual in Russia. Internal EU tensions will surely grow as the war drags on amid “sanctions fatigue”. Since Biden, Nato and the Europeans lack an agreed long-term strategy to save Ukraine, could this be “global Britain’s” big moment? Boris Johnson went to Saudi Arabia last week, in search of cheap oil. Photograph: Stuart Wallace/REX/Shutterstock What’s the plan, Boris? Alas, he doesn’t have one either. As usual, Britain’s Churchill tribute act is hugging Washington close, whatever he may privately think about Biden’s leadership. His UK Joint Expeditionary Force carries an unfortunate whiff of Dunkirk. Doing America’s bidding, Boris Johnson went cap in hand to Saudi Arabia last week in search of cheap oil and was ritually humiliated by another mass murderer. Far from holding the ring, Britain, as matters stand, will not even be in the room this week when Europe ponders its biggest security and refugee crisis since 1945. Who’d have thought Brexit could make the plight of Ukrainians any worse? But it has.",,,,

United Nations data showed as of Thursday about 3.2 million people have fled Ukraine, in what has become Europe’s fastest-growing refugee crisis since the second world war. The UN said some of the 2 million people entering Poland from Ukraine have moved on to other countries in the EU but the “the majority are believed to be still in Poland”. On Thursday, Biden will attend an emergency Nato summit, a G7 meeting and a scheduled European Council summit to discuss Ukraine, “including transatlantic efforts to impose economic costs on Russia, provide humanitarian support to those affected by the violence, and address other challenges related to the conflict”, the White House said.

Biden, who faces growing dissatisfaction over his approach to the war, will travel to Brussels on Thursday and then on to Poland, it was announced on Sunday night. He will hear a proposal from Poland for Nato to send a peacekeeping force into Ukraine, something Linda Thomas-Greenfield said was unlikely.  ‘Tucker the Untouchable’ goes soft on Putin but remains Fox News’s biggest powerRead more Thomas-Greenfield was reacting on CNN’s State of the Union to an interview with Volodymr Zelenskiy in which the Ukrainian president told the same network only talks would end the war and its devastating toll on civilians. “We have to use any format, any chance, to have the possibility of negotiating, of talking to [Russian president Vladimir] Putin,” Zelenskiy told Fareed Zakaria, the host of GPS. “If these attempts fail, that would mean that this is a third world war.” Thomas-Greenfield said she saw little chance of a breakthrough. “We have supported the negotiations that President Zelenskiy has attempted with the Russians, and I use the word attempted because the negotiations seem to be one-sided, and the Russians have not leaned in to any possibility for a negotiated and diplomatic solution,” she said. “We tried before Russia decided to move forward in this brutal attack on Ukraine and those diplomatic efforts were not responded to well by the Russians, and they’re not responding now. But we’re still hopeful that the Ukrainian effort will end this brutal war.” The Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, told NBC’s Meet the Press: “Turkey is doing some real effort to try to facilitate, support talks between Russia and Ukraine. It’s far too early to say whether these talks can lead to any concrete outcome.” Thomas-Greenfield talked down the prospects of a Nato peacekeeping force in Ukraine. “I can’t preview what decisions will be made and how Nato will respond to the Polish proposal,” she said. “What I can say is American troops will not be on the ground in Ukraine at this moment. The president has been clear on that. Earlier, she told the programme: “Other Nato countries may decide that they want to put troops inside of Ukraine, that will be a decision that they have made. We don’t want to escalate this into a war with the United States but we will support our Nato allies.” Thomas-Greenfield was asked about reports that thousands of residents of the besieged city of Mariupol have been deported to Russia. “I’ve only heard it,” she said. “I can’t confirm it. But I can say it is disturbing. It is unconscionable for Russia to force Ukrainian citizens into Russia and put them in what will basically be concentration and prisoner camps.” Republicans were critical of the pace and content of US support for Ukraine. Following Zelenskiy’s address to Congress on Wednesday, the White House announced $800m in military aid, following a $13.6bn package. But Biden has rejected a no-fly zone and the transfer of Polish MiG fighter jets. “The president has had to be pushed and pulled to where he is today,” the Wyoming Republican senator John Barasso told ABC’s This Week. “It was Congress that brought about sanctions, that brought about the ban on Russian oil, that brought about weapons and all of this big aid package. So far the administration has only released $1bn of that. We might not have been in this situation if they had done punishing sanctions before the tanks began to roll.” Speaking to CBS’s Face the Nation, the Senate minority leader, Mitch McConnell, said he believed Biden “needs to step up his game”. The president, McConnell said: “has generally done the right thing but never soon enough. I am perplexed as to why we couldn’t get the Polish-Russian MiGs into the country.” McConnell added that Biden should visit friendly countries close to the conflict zone, such as Romania, Poland and the Baltic nations. “They’re right on the frontlines and need to know that we’re in this fight with them to win,” he said. His comments came before the White House announced Biden would travel to Warsaw. McConnell also condemned Republican extremists who have opposed support for Ukraine, such as the North Carolina congressman Madison Cawthorne, who has called Zelenskiy “a thug”. “There are some lonely voices out there who are in a different place,” McConnell said. The House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, speaks before Volodymyr Zelenskiy delivers a video address to Congress. Photograph: Reuters Concern is rising among Biden’s allies. Dick Durbin of Illinois, the Democratic Senate whip, reiterated the call to approve air support for Ukraine. “We’re asking for one-third of the Polish air force to be sent into Ukraine,” he told ABC. The people of Poland, of course, want to make certain that they’re safe. They’re only a few miles away from the devastation that’s going on in Ukraine. “There are other ways for us to provide surface-to-air missiles and air defenses that will keep the Russians at bay in terms of their aerial attacks. There are ways to do that that are consistent with the Nato alliance and would not jeopardise expanding this into world war three or even worse.” Marek Magierowski, the Polish ambassador to the US, stressed that the proposal for a peacekeeping force in Ukraine was only “a preliminary concept”. “We can’t take any decisions unilaterally, they have to be taken by all Nato members,” he told CNN, adding: “If there is an incursion into Nato territory, I believe that Russia can expect a very harsh response on the part of our alliance.” Zelenskiy lamented the provision only of economic and limited military support. “If we were a Nato member, a war wouldn’t have started,” he said. “If Nato members are ready to see us in the alliance, do it immediately because people are dying on a daily basis. “But if you are not ready to preserve the lives of our people, if you just want to see us straddle two worlds, if you want to see us in this dubious position where we don’t understand whether you can accept us or not, you cannot place us in this situation, you cannot force us to be in this limbo.” Zelenskiy, however, appeared to acknowledge last week that Ukraine would not join Nato. Marina Ovsyannikova, Russian TV protester, decries Putin propagandaRead more On CBS’s Face the Nation, the US defense secretary, Lloyd Austin, said the use of chemical weapons by Russia, which many analysts predict, would produce a “significant reaction” from the US and the international community. On NBC, Stoltenberg said the use of chemical weapons “would be a blatant and brutal violation of international law”. But he would not say such an outcome would change Nato policy towards intervention. Biden this week spoke to the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, seeking to prevent support for Russia. The Chinese ambassador to the US, Qin Gang, spoke to CBS. He said: “What China is doing is sending food, medicine, sleeping bags and baby formula, not weapons and ammunition to any party.” Gang also said Chinese condemnation of the Russian invasion, for which some have called, would not “solve the problem”. “I would be surprised if Russia will back down by condemnation,” he said. In Ukraine, fighting continues. The retired US army general and former CIA director David Petraeus told CNN the conflict had reached “a bloody stalemate, with lots of continued damage on both sides, lots of destruction, especially from the Russians”.

It is true that Brexit doesn’t prevent the prime minister taking an active role in supporting Ukraine against Kremlin aggression. British military hardware is appreciated on the frontline. Mr Johnson can be in the loop of western diplomacy without a seat at the EU table. He will also be attending a Nato summit in Brussels on Thursday. In the Brexiter view, UK interests in Europe can be managed through the North Atlantic alliance and bilateral conversations with continental leaders.  If that were true, and the EU were a strategic sideshow, Joe Biden would not be attending both summits in Brussels. But the US president recognises something that Mr Johnson denies – the European Council is a place where decisions of consequence are made. The prime minister would serve his country’s interests better from inside the room. The outbreak of war had raised hopes that the bombast and pettiness that has too often coloured British debate about the relationship with continental neighbours might be set aside. That hope was dashed when Mr Johnson made a speech last week drawing a grotesque comparison between Ukrainian resistance to the Russian invasion and the UK’s decision to leave the EU. Both reflected a common appetite for liberty, the prime minister said, mining a depth of crass cynicism to which even staunch critics did not think him capable of sinking. The trivialising thrust of the analogy was made all the more insulting in the context of Ukrainian ambitions to join the very European project that Mr Johnson casts as an imperial aggressor. For Volodymyr Zelenskiy, the EU and Nato are twin pillars of a democratic European order that stands in opposition to the worldview advanced by Vladimir Putin, where the rule of law is meaningless, might is right and borders are erased at a dictator’s whim. The concept of Europe as a democratic bastion was understood by countries of the former Warsaw Pact that sought Nato and EU membership as a package in the early 2000s. It is also understood by Mr Putin, who sees undermining EU solidarity as instrumental to the goal of sabotaging western interests. That is why he backed Brexit. That EU solidarity, resolute at the start of the war, is under strain. There are differences over the shape and pace of new sanctions against Moscow and how to meet the cost. The Baltic states and Poland, having more experience of Kremlin hostility, are hawkish in wanting to maximise pressure on Moscow. Germany resists embargos that might weaken European economies by limiting energy supplies and stoking prices. This week’s summit is likely to produce only conditional statements of tougher intent, not tougher action, disappointing those who would push harder against the Putin regime. That is a debate in which Britain would like a say. As one of the continent’s economic and military powers, it also has sway. Mr Johnson can be influential from outside a Brussels summit, but he has forfeited a say over the agenda. He has no one but himself to blame if decisions are made that he would have opposed had he been at the table.",/p/y5xah,306,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/mar/22/the-guardian-view-on-boris-johnson-in-brussels-drop-the-brexit-rhetoric#comments,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e741bcea1e15bdd548573f43317ec77dae9807bf/8_351_2767_1660/master/2767.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=a97517e57b549fe20f5df2036ff0fb63

Boris Johnson will tell world leaders at the Nato summit on Thursday that the conflict is entering a new phase of aggression and humanitarian catastrophe with the siege of Mariupol and the indiscriminate attacks on civilians.  Western officials have said that both the Ukrainians and the Russians are running short of weapons as the conflict grinds on due to Ukrainian defence that was far better than expected – and that they had anticipated they would be supporting a smaller Ukrainian insurgency by this stage. Ahead of the summit, Johnson said the UK would provide 6,000 new defensive missiles, including high-explosive weapons, and £25m from Foreign Office funds to help Ukraine pay its military and police forces. Not all of the missiles are expected to be next-generation light anti-tank weapons (NLAWs) – of which the UK has already provided more than 4,200. The defence secretary, Ben Wallace, was filmed saying that the UK would send more missiles but was “running out of our own” on a prank call last week. Please don’t compare Ukraine to Brexit, Petro Poroshenko asks Boris JohnsonRead more The additional weaponry means that the UK has now provided more than 10,000 missiles. It will be supplying Starstreak high-velocity anti-air missiles to help Ukrainians defend themselves against aerial bombings, as well as body armour, helmets and combat boots. But No 10 said it was hoped that international partners would also send weapons needed for longer-range targeting and intelligence. Johnson also pledged new cash to counter Russian disinformation as well as support and funding for the International Criminal Court investigation into possible war crimes committed by the Kremlin and invading forces. The talks with Nato and G7 leaders, which will be followed by a European Council meeting to which Johnson has not been invited, mark one month since the Russian invasion. “Vladimir Putin is already failing in Ukraine,” Johnson said in a statement ahead of the summit in Brussels. “The Ukrainian people have shown themselves to be extraordinarily brave and tenacious in defending their homeland, in the face of an unprovoked onslaught. But we cannot and will not stand by while Russia grinds Ukraine’s towns and cities into dust. “The United Kingdom will work with our allies to step up military and economic support to Ukraine, strengthening their defences as they turn the tide in this fight. One month into this crisis, the international community faces a choice. We can keep the flame of freedom alive in Ukraine, or risk it being snuffed out across Europe and the world.” No 10 said that 4 million items of medical equipment and 500 mobile generators will also be sent to Ukraine. The UK will also assign soldiers with expertise in intelligence gathering to the ICC investigation, as well as an additional £1m in funding after a meeting of justice and foreign affairs ministers with justice secretary Dominic Raab at The Hague. “President Putin and his commanders should know that they will be held to account for their actions, and risk ending up spending the rest of their days behind bars,” Raab said at the meeting’s conclusion.",,,,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/47d9f9806adb22b6a73a263983bc2da81dd93b56/0_202_7952_4775/master/7952.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=4a33916f4448e1336a9fab79ca0bb7af

Biden will take part in an emergency Nato summit, a G7 summit and a meeting of the European Council in Brussels on Thursday – all groups that largely welcome a return of US leadership and engagement in Europe after the nadir of the Donald Trump administration.  The Biden team is hoping to translate that goodwill into political stamina over what could well be a long, gruelling conflict. On Wednesday night, President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said Ukraine was “waiting for meaningful steps” from the three gatherings and listed so-far unheeded requests, such as a no-fly zone, aircraft and tanks. “Our firm position will be represented at these three summits. At these three summits we will see: who is a friend, who is a partner, and who betrayed us for money.” Biden’s trip will also, to some extent, be a lap of honour for the US president’s success so far in keeping allies and partners together in confronting Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine. Jake Sullivan, the national security adviser, told journalists on Air Force One on the way to Brussels: “What we would like to hear is that the resolve and unity that we’ve seen for the past month will endure for as long as it takes.” But ratcheting up pressure on the Kremlin as the atrocities in Ukraine worsen will be far harder than the concerted measures taken so far. There are fundamental splits within the EU on whether to follow the US in imposing an embargo on energy imports from Russia, with Germany, which is heavily dependent, adamantly against. The chancellor, Olaf Scholz, has argued it would hurt Germany more than Russia. Boycott of Russian gas and oil ‘could cause mass poverty in Germany’Read more Previewing the trip, Sullivan made clear that the president was not going to push the issue, sensitive to the fact that the implications for Germany and other European states are far more severe than for the US, which imported a very small amount of Russian oil. Biden, Sullivan said, recognized “that some of our European allies and partners would not be able to follow suit and he was not going to pressure them to do so”. “There’s a lot more room to ratchet up sanctions if the United States and Europe decide to do so,” Edward Fishman, a former senior state department official focused on sanctions, said. “We’re at about a seven or eight out of 10 in intensity. We’re definitely not a 10 out of 10.” “I think the most important sanction that the US and Europe could impose would be a global campaign to reduce Russian oil sales across the board,” Fishman, now at Columbia University’s school of international and public affairs, added. “I don’t anticipate that’s going to come out of the meeting tomorrow. However, some of the groundwork for that campaign could be laid.” Biden will make an announcement on Friday morning, before leaving Brussels for Poland, on a long-term initiative to reduce European dependence on Russian oil and gas, the national security adviser said. A package of new sanctions due to be announced on Thursday will partly involve the US catching up with Europe. Sullivan said that some of the new raft of measures will target Russian politicians and oligarchs. The Wall Street Journal has reported, for example, that Biden will announce targeted measures on members of the Russian state Duma. The US could also enlarge its list of sanctioned Russian oligarchs, which is missing some of the names that are on European and British lists. It is also possible more Russian banks and state enterprises will be added to a blacklist, which would cut them off from using the Belgium-based Swift financial messaging system. Sullivan said a principal focus will be on tighter enforcement of existing measures, coordinated through the G7. Part of Thursday’s announcement, he said would be “a joint effort to crack down on evasion on sanctions-busting, on any attempt by any country to help Russia basically undermine or weaken or get around the sanctions”. That may mean more details of a joint taskforce aimed at tracking down the hidden assets of the oligarchs, Putin’s circle and their extended families. China’s decisive turning point: will it side with Russia and divide the world?Read more Another tougher element of the European Council meeting will be an effort to forge a common front towards China, before a planned EU summit with Xi Jinping next week. Biden wants the Europeans to echo the US message that any supplies of Chinese armaments to the faltering Russian military campaign would have severe consequences for economic relations. The Nato meeting will in theory be an easier affair. On the eve of the summit, the alliance announced it will double the number of its deployed battlegroups, sending them to Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria and Slovakia, matching the bilateral deployments already made by the US, the UK and others to Poland and the Baltic states. The secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, said there would be more announcements on the eastern flank on Thursday. Behind closed doors, the leaders will have to make plans for how to respond to a range of extreme contingencies, like the use of chemical, biological or nuclear weapons by a desperate Putin. Before boarding the Marine One helicopter on the first leg of his trip, Biden repeated his warning that chemical weapons, in particular, remain a serious threat. There will also be a discussion of Nato’s long-term plans in terms of deployments. Under a 1997 agreement with Russia, the US agreed not to deploy its troops permanently in the frontline states. Since the annexation of Crimea in 2014 it has stepped up the US presence in Poland and the Baltic states, but in rotating deployments to honour the letter of that agreement. But the US and its closest allies now see that deal as worthless and the road is open to contemplate permanent basing, which the Baltic nations, in particular have been calling for. “We don’t have all the answers yet,” Julianne Smith, the US ambassador to Nato, said. “Permanent stationing could be one solution or persistent rotations is another option that could be on the table. At this point, what we need to do is have our military commanders give us the best advice they can and come to us with specific proposals.” Nato needs permanent force in eastern Europe to deter Russia, says EstoniaRead more Underpinning those discussions will be the nagging insecurity that eastern European states have over whether the US would really come to their rescue in the event of a Russian attack. Biden’s trip to Poland on Friday and Saturday will in part be intended to address that anxiety. The president and the Europeans will be meeting are acutely aware that his predecessor called US commitment to Nato into question, and that Trump could return to the presidency in 2025. Robert Hunter, a former US ambassador to Nato, argued: “The alliance, and particularly the United States, must also recognize, if only sotto voce for now, how serious the credibility problem has become and the need for it to rise to the top of the long-term US and Nato foreign policy agenda.”",,,,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/71381008d38184b3c81c61d3521e58d91d97185c/0_162_4500_2701/master/4500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=ea9c999449563ec6e5719a3eebe79c50

Jens Stoltenberg, the organisation’s secretary general, also told Russia to stop engaging in “nuclear sabre-rattling” and repeated warnings that the Kremlin could be seeking “a pretext” for using chemical weapon as the war heads into a second month.  “I expect allies will agree to provide additional support” including “equipment to help Ukraine protect against chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear threats”, he said the day before the meeting. The Nato chief declined to spell out exactly what would be supplied, though it is likely to include gas masks and protective suits. But his statement reflects heightened uncertainty across alliance members about Russian intentions as the invasion of Ukraine has stalled on multiple fronts. Stoltenberg described Russian comments that it would be willing to deploy nuclear weapons if Nato directly entered the conflict as “dangerous and … irresponsible”. On Tuesday, Dimitry Peskov, the spokesperson for Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, had said nuclear arms could be used if Moscow thought it faced an “existential threat”. Russia’s war in Ukraine: complete guide in maps, video and picturesRead more The secretary general acknowledged that Nato was “concerned about the possibility of use of chemical weapons or biological weapons” in Ukraine, partly because of “false claims that Ukraine, supported by Nato allies, [is] producing and preparing for the use of chemical weapons”. No firm evidence has been produced to justify the Russian statements, but Stoltenberg said such accusations “may be a way for them to, in a way, try to create the pretext for their use of chemical weapons” – echoing an almost identical warning made by the US president, Joe Biden, overnight before travelling to Europe. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, will address Biden, the UK prime minister, Boris Johnson, and the other Nato leaders assembling in Brussels on Thursday morning via video link, in an emergency meeting to discuss further military responses to the ongoing crisis triggered by Russia’s invasion last month. Poland is expected to present a proposal for a multinational peacekeeping mission in Ukraine at the meeting. But there is no support from the US or many other allies for a no-fly zone or any other direct Nato intervention, despite the increasingly bloody fighting. Stoltenberg was quick to play down any possibility of direct military involvement. “Nato will not send troops into Ukraine,” the secretary general said, drawing a distinction between member countries supplying anti-tank and other arms to Kyiv and the deployment of any forces on the ground. “When it comes to forces, Nato is not part of the conflict. We provide support to Ukraine but we’re not part of the conflict. We help Ukraine with upholding the right for self-defence, which is enshrined in the UN charter,” the secretary general said, suggesting it was unlikely the Polish proposal would develop further for now. The Kremlin has warned Nato countries not to deploy peacekeepers to Ukraine, saying that could lead to a direct confrontation between Russia and Nato. A deployment would be a “reckless and extremely dangerous decision”, Peskov said during a telephone call with journalists on Wednesday. Nato needs permanent force in eastern Europe to deter Russia, says EstoniaRead more “A special military operation is going on, and any possible contact by our troops with Nato troops can lead to quite clear consequences that would be hard to repair,” Peskov said. The Russian deputy foreign minister, Sergei Ryabkov, had previously called western military shipments to Ukraine “legitimate military targets”, suggesting that Russia could be on the verge of entering a direct confrontation with Nato countries sending lethal aid to Ukraine. But so far Russia has not directly targeted the shipments, western officials have said. Russia’s placement of sophisticated anti-air defences in Belarus and military deployments to the Black Sea ahead of its invasion of Ukraine were also seen by analysts as a signal to western countries not to intervene in the conflict. Putin also held military drills of the Russia’s strategic nuclear forces in late February. Nato leaders are also expected on Thursday to agree to increase troop deployments on its eastern flank with the creation of four new multinational battlegroups in Romania, Bulgaria, Slovakia and Hungary to protect against any sudden Russian attack, alongside those already established in Poland and the Baltic states. Discussions will also take place about increasing the military presence near Russia even further still, as part of a process that will conclude at Nato’s scheduled annual summit in June. “I expect a part of that will be a significant increase of our presence on the ground in the eastern part of the alliance for the long term,” Stoltenberg added. The Nato meeting will be one of a string of leaders’ gatherings held in Brussels on Thursday. G7 and EU leaders are also holding meetings later in the day, with Biden a guest at the EU summit. The other meetings are likely to focus on trying to agree a further toughening of economic sanctions.",,,,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8bfd8143b48df125b057abcbc9fb954108c50572/0_0_3898_2339/master/3898.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=efed6f8a9886e559d8ec0d409157d53f

Ahead of Thursday’s Nato summit, Jonatan Vseviov, the permanent secretary of the Estonian foreign ministry, said that Europe and the North Atlantic alliance could never return to the world it knew before the 24 February Russian invasion of Ukraine.  “We will be in a totally new security environment. There will be a new Ukraine. There will be a new Russia. There will be a new Europe. There is no going back to February 23,” Vseviov told the Guardian in an interview in Washington. More than 20,000 Nato troops, the overwhelming majority of them US forces, have been deployed to the Baltic states, Poland and the rest of eastern Europe in the aftermath of the invasion. There had previously been only a few thousand alliance forces in the region, intended to serve as a tripwire which would be overrun in the event of a Russian attack. The presence of US and western European soldiers among them, however, was intended to leave Moscow in no doubt that those countries would send in large reinforcements. Vseviov, a former Estonian ambassador to Washington, argued that the Kremlin had miscalculated so badly in Ukraine – over its own military strength, Ukrainian capability and determination, and western resolve – that it could no longer be taken for granted Moscow would get the message, and believe Nato reinforcements would come to the rescue. “The tripwire-based approach is dependent upon an assumption that the one that is being deterred understands the link between the tripwire and reinforcing forces,” he said. ‘Putin only understands strength’: Estonian PM on Ukraine tensionsRead more “Knowing this and understanding that we need to now build Nato’s defense and deterrence, and European security in general, for the long haul,” Vseviov said, “we need to move from a tripwire-based deterrence towards a forward defence-based deterrence, or a deterrence by denial, if you will.” He said the amount of troops and equipment needed would depend on military planners and on different situations in different countries. The force did not have to be big enough to stop Russia making any territorial gains, but sufficient to put up stiff resistance. “We need to be less reliant on reinforcements, and we need to have more of the defensive forces in the frontline states on day one,” Vseviov said. “I think there will be wide political consensus in Nato on the need to move that way, and the exact details are being worked out.” The US national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, confirmed that long-term changes in Nato’s posture in Europe would be discussed this week. “Right now, our secretary of defence and the supreme allied commander in Europe believe that they have an effective posture today for what’s necessary today,” Sullivan said. “The second [question] is what is the longer-term force posture, not just for this contingency, this emergency, this invasion, but over the course of time? That is something the president will discuss with his allies at the Nato summit on Thursday.” Since the end of the cold war, Nato’s ability to move armies from west to east has decayed. Retired rear admiral Mark Montgomery, a former deputy director for plans, policy and strategy at US European Command, said the number of rail carriages for transporting tanks and other heavy equipment diminished from the high hundreds to a handful, for example. The infrastructure has only recently begun to be rebuilt. “I think this actually shows that the Baltic plan to try to get the United States further and further integrated with increasingly larger sets of units is the right play,” Montgomery, now a senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies thinktank, said. “You want the US with boots on the ground from day one.”",,,,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d184419147cba44d489446cfa01c363177fc597a/0_356_5497_3301/master/5497.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=31568ef04da5e1dd1a7c567df6871f3d

The supreme court confirmation hearing for Ketanji Brown Jackson concluded on Thursday, with judges and lawyers extolling her as a “brilliant” legal mind and exceptional jurist. Senate minority leader Mitch McConnell announced he would not support Jackson’s historic nomination to the court in a sign of how difficult it will be for her to win Republican votes.
The state department announced indictments against four Russian nationals for allegedly attempting to hack hundreds of energy companies in countries around the world. It comes as the US is on heightened alert for a cyberattack by Russia.
Joe Biden met in Brussels with allied leaders to discuss the war in Ukraine. He warned Vladimir Putin against using chemical weapons and said Russia should be removed from the G20. If not, he said Ukraine should be added to the group. 
The US and its allies announced new sanctions on more than 400 Russian elites and institutions. 
The US will accept up to 100,000 Ukrainian refugees who have fled their country because of the war. The White House also announced it will provide more than $1bn in humanitarian assistance to Ukraine, helping its citizens access food, medical care and psychological treatment.

Updated at 20.26 GMT 24 Mar 202219.49The Guardian’s Dominic Rushe also wrote about falling jobless claims, providing context as to why many Americans are still unhappy with the state of the economy despite signs of economic recovery:In April 2020, during the height of the first wave of the pandemic, weekly unemployment claims hit a record 6.6m and they stayed above 1m until August. But the remarkable recovery in the jobs market has coincided with soaring inflation and left many Americans unhappy with the Biden administration’s handling of the economy.
The majority of Americans (58%) surveyed for the latest Grinnell College national poll believe the economy will be worse a year from now and just 37% approve of Joe Biden’s handling of the economy, according to Gallup.
At least a dozen states are considering paying rebate checks of several hundred dollars directly to taxpayers to ease the burden of soaring prices for gas, food, utilities and other essentials.
A proposal from the Maine governor, Janet Mills, is among the most generous in a state where the cost of food and fuel has soared in recent months. The Democratic governor wants to send $850 to most residents as part of the state’s budget bill.

The House select committee investigating the January 6 Capitol attack will consider holding in criminal contempt of Congress next week two of Donald Trump’s most senior White House advisers in Dan Scavino and Peter Navarro, the panel announced on Thursday.
The move to initiate contempt proceedings against the two Trump aides amounts to a biting rebuke of their refusal to cooperate with the inquiry, as the panel deploys its most punitive measures to reaffirm the consequences of noncompliance.
House investigators said in a notice that it would consider a contempt report against Scavino and Navarro in a business meeting scheduled for next Monday on Capitol Hill, after they defied subpoenas compelling them to provide documents and testimony.
The select committee is expected to vote unanimously to send the contempt report for a vote before the House of Representatives, according to a source close to the panel, so that the Trump aides can be referred to the justice department for prosecution.
The select committee took a special interest in Scavino, since, as Trump’s former deputy chief of staff for communications, he was intimately involved in a months-long effort by the Trump White House to overturn the results of the 2020 election.Read the full article here.

Trump’s allegations in the lawsuit are undermined by a 966-page report issued by a Republican-led U.S. Senate committee in August 2020. That report concluded that Russia used Republican political operative Paul Manafort and the WikiLeaks website to try to help Trump win the 2016 election.
Manafort worked on Trump’s presidential campaign for five months in 2016.
Russia’s alleged election interference, which Moscow denies, sparked a two-year-long U.S. investigation headed by Special Counsel Robert Mueller.
In the lawsuit, Trump is seeking compensatory and punitive damages.

So low was the bar set by former US president Donald Trump that, merely by condemning Russia’s Vladimir Putin rather than gushing over his biceps, Joe Biden earned good will on his unity and resolve tour of Europe.  The president came to Brussels on Thursday with promises to accept up to 100,000 Ukrainian refugees fleeing the month-long Russian invasion, give $1bn in new humanitarian aid and impose sanctions on 300 members of the Russian parliament. It was an attempt to project reassurance that Biden, born during the second world war, can emulate President Franklin Roosevelt’s “great arsenal of democracy” without stumbling into a third. US expands Russian sanctions and plans to accept 100,000 Ukrainian refugeesRead more But the 79-year-old’s handshakes and whispers with France’s Emmanuel Macron and others at the Nato, G7 and European Council summits may put the seal on the Obama paradox: an American president more popular abroad than at home. Gallup surveys conducted before Russia invaded Ukraine showed the image of US leadership making a significant recovery from the Trump era. “Between 2020 and 2021, American leadership saw double-digit gains in 20 of the 27 Nato members surveyed both years,” the polling firm said. That stands in vivid contrast with Biden’s approval rating within the US, which this week fell to a new low of 40%, according to a Reuters/ Ipsos opinion poll. The survey found that 54% of Americans disapprove of his job performance as the country struggles with high inflation. Biden’s approval rating matched Trump’s at this point in his presidency: both stood at 40% in mid-March in their second year in office. The relief of western allies at having America back at the table is unlikely to be reflected by domestic voters in the midterm elections in November. That is why Republicans are hammering away at Biden by urging him to do more for Ukraine though with few specific details and, more loudly and convincingly to the electorate, by blaming him for soaring gas prices at home. They intend to prove the old adage that all politics is local. The point was illustrated on prime time cable news television on Wednesday night. CNN’s Anderson Cooper opened his show with coverage of the war in Ukraine; Tucker Carlson, on the conservative Fox News channel, talked instead about supreme court nominee Ketanji Brown Jackson declining to offer a definition of “woman” during her Senate confirmation hearing. CNN’s Reliable Sources newsletter noted: “As Cooper showed horrifying drone footage of the widespread devastation in Mariupol, Carlson showed his audience a sex-ed type graphic of the female reproductive system.” It observed: “Four weeks after the war commenced, there are signs that fatigue is setting in. TV news ratings, for instance, have started to fall back to reality after ballooning early on. And perhaps another sign is the return of culture idiocy that is once again saturating channels like Fox and social media feeds.” It is a further reminder to be grateful that Trump no longer has his finger on the Twitter button – or the nuclear one. The man who once posed the biggest threat to global democracy has been replaced in that role by Putin. Biden beat one and must now thwart the other. So far that has meant a “Goldilocks” approach – not too hot, not too cold, not too weak, not too provocative. This received a boost on Thursday when Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy delivered a video address to Nato from Kyiv that did not, according to White House officials, include calls for a no-fly zone or Nato membership, giving Biden some breathing room. Still, Zelinskiy naturally urged Nato to stiffen its spine and do more, and it remains unclear how Biden will respond if an increasingly desperate Putin resorts to biological, chemical or even nuclear weapons. Western unity will be tested as the costs of war bite into the global economy. The German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, dismissed calls to follow the US by boycotting Russian energy supplies, warning: “To do so from one day to the next would mean plunging our country and all of Europe into recession.” The president who made a contest between democracy and autocracy the guiding principle of his foreign policy will also be aware that Thursday’s meetings are being watched closely by China, which has sent mixed signals about the invasion and may yet give Putin military support. China’s decisive turning point: will it side with Russia and divide the world?Read more Nato’s determined response, and the underperformance of the bogged down Russian army, may serve as a warning to Chinese president Xi Jinping and scramble his calculus for an assault on Taiwan. Larry Diamond, a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution thinktank in Palo Alto, California, told reporters this week: “Xi is pissed as hell because it completely changes the timeline and the dynamics of the situation. “The most fascinating dimension of this crisis right now is to watch Xi Jinping be completely tied up in knots over what to do about this. He and the senior Chinese leadership are clearly struggling for a narrative and a response.” Standing against a blue backdrop dotted with Nato logos, Biden addressed the issue of Chinese intervention at a press conference. He recalled that, in a recent call with Xi, he pointed out that many US and foreign corporations have left Russia. “I indicated that he would be putting himself in significant jeopardy. I think that China understands that its economic futures are much more closely tied to the west than it is to Russia. So I’m hopeful that he does not get engaged.” He reiterated his message to Brussels that America is back. But towards the end of the question and answer session, someone raised European concerns that Trump might get re-elected in 2024 – raising the spectre of a return to the uncertainty, insults and Putin-praise singing. The president replied: “One of the things I take some solace from is I don’t think you’ll find any European leader who thinks that I am not up to the job… I don’t criticise anybody for asking that question. But the next election, I’d be very fortunate if I had that same man running against me.” Steeped in foreign policy after decades as a senator and vice-president, Biden is likely to be thinking about geopolitical questions in terms of decades. Unfortunately for him, his political legacy could be decided by Tucker Carlson and viewers’ demand for instant gratification.",,,,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8b43589edab82a6a0524a951e366ed6ca59c041d/0_7_4500_2700/master/4500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=aa3e8215504c9ab4a0a2c6300760946d

Speaking after two extraordinary meetings of Nato and the G7, the prime minister also admitted allies were constrained in delivering tanks and jets to Ukraine, despite a direct plea by the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy.  Johnson warned the UK is unlikely to supply jets and tanks to Ukraine, amid calls from Zelenskiy for the new heavy weaponry. In a speech at the summit by video link, Zelenskiy did not repeat his call for a no-fly zone but said Ukraine needed jets and tanks from Nato to aid its besieged cities. “You have at least 20,000 tanks! Ukraine asked for a per cent, 1% of all your tanks to be given or sold to us. But we do not have a clear answer yet,” he said. “The worst thing during the war is not having clear answers to requests for help.” Johnson said that the UK was “looking at what we could do to help” with tanks but suggested it was impossible. “Logistically, the moment it looks very difficult for both the armour and with jets. We’re very conscious of what he’s asking for. US expands Russian sanctions and plans to accept 100,000 Ukrainian refugeesRead more “At the moment, we’re looking at the equipment that we think is more immediately valuable … They need protection from that absolutely merciless onslaught from artillery.” The prime minister said at his meeting with the G7, his Japanese counterpart had spoken movingly about the use of nuclear and chemical weapons. “There is a visceral horror of the use of these weapons of mass destruction,” he said. Johnson said in an interview as he departed the summit that he feared Putin intended to level Ukrainian cities as he did in Chechnya. “Putin doesn’t take peace talks seriously – he wants to double down and Groznyfy Ukraine’s great cities,” he told BBC Newsnight. “I think that’s a tragic mistake, but that’s what he seem to be doing at the moment.”Johnson would not commit to future Nato membership for Ukraine, something Zelenskiy has said he could be prepared to forgo as part of peace negotiations. Johnson said allies would instead be “strengthening the quills of the Ukrainian porcupine as to make it in future indigestible to the Russian invaders”. Speaking earlier, Johnson said the US president, Joe Biden, was right to warn about the risk of a staged false flag attack. “You have to have a bit of ambiguity about your response, but I think it would be catastrophic for him if he were to do that, and I think that he understands that,” he told a press conference in Brussels. “When the Russians start doing stuff about ‘there are factories in Ukraine producing American biological weapons’ you know that is a prelude to a false flag operation.” Behind the scenes, officials say there is virtually zero prospect of a military intervention. “I think very few people think that Nato entering into conflict with Russia will stop the war – it will escalate the war,” one western official said. 01:39'I'm not remotely anti-Russian,' says Boris Johnson – video “We are remaining deliberately ambiguous. We don’t want to say exactly how we will respond because Putin will then price that in to his calculations. We want him to remain uncertain … but we are clear there will be severe consequences.” Nato leaders agreed Ukraine required supplies of protective equipment against chemical and biological weapons, which Biden has expressed particular concern could be in the offing. But leaders agreed it was clear that any chemical attack spilling across the border into a Nato country would not be considered a direct attack on the alliance. Both the US and the UK are expected to begin supplies to Ukrainian civilians, though officials acknowledged it was difficult to know where to target supplies. “There is protective equipment which we can supply to Ukrainians such as wash-up kits and protection kits and so on,” one official aid. “That’s something we need to work through because we don’t have 44 million of these kits and clearly we don’t know where or when or how they would use such weapons.” Overnight, the prime minister said the UK would double the number of British missiles sent to Ukraine with an additional 6,000, and send an extra £25m to Ukraine’s military. During their three-hour meeting, the 30 heads of government discussed the limits of upgrading weapons supply to Ukraine, without provoking Russia further. Johnson also denied claims from Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov that he was “most active anti-Russian leader” – though privately No 10 has been delighted at the description. “I think it’s very, very important for everybody to understand that there’s not a single person around the table in Nato, or the G7 who is against Russians or the Russian people. Least of all me, the only prime minister in UK history to be called Boris. I’m not remotely anti-Russian. But I think what we all agree, is that what Vladimir Putin is doing, the way he’s leading Russia at the moment is actually catastrophic.”",,,,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8c20e710c892961b97e592ae6c9c21df5c7c97bb/0_9_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=63e39ec6fc00afb9dcc8d43bac332983

Speaking in the aftermath of emergency Nato and G7 summits in Brussels, the US president said that any retaliation would be proportional, though he would not confirm that he would insist on military action.  “We would respond,” Biden said, in response to a question about what Nato would do. “We would respond if he uses it. The nature of the response would depend on the nature of the use.” The US wanted to see Russia thrown out of the G20 club of leading economic nations, although Biden complained that wasn’t immediately possible because “Indonesia and others do not agree”. Biden and other western leaders have become fearful that a struggling Russia may try to end Ukraine’s stubborn resistance in the war that has already lasted a month and claimed thousands of lives, with a chemical – or biological or nuclear – attack. Nato leaders: concern about a possible Russian chemical or biological attack dominated the summit Photograph: Getty Images This week it emerged that the White House had set up a special “Tiger Team” to work out how the US would respond if such an attack should take place. But on Thursday, Biden also said: “It would trigger a response in kind” – meaning it would reflect what had taken place. Concern about a possible Russian chemical or biological attack dominated the Nato summit on Thursday. Speaking a few minutes before Biden, UK prime minister Boris Johnson warned of disastrous consequences for Russia should Putin use chemical weapons in Ukraine. “You have to have a bit of ambiguity about your response, but I think it would be catastrophic for him if he were to do that – and I think that he understands that,” Johnson told a press conference. All 30 Nato leaders warned Russia against using chemical or biological weapons in Ukraine, arguing in a final summit statement that any such use “would be unacceptable and result in severe consequences”. However, again they did not spell out what the response would be. One western official said on Thursday they thought it would be “highly unlikely” that there would be a direct military response even if Russia used chemical weapons in Ukraine, although any final decision would be driven by the US. That would risk a severe escalation of the conflict, the official said. “We are remaining deliberately ambiguous. We don’t want to say exactly how we will respond because Putin will then price that in to his calculations. We want him to remain uncertain … but we are clear there will be severe consequences,” they added. Masks, protective suits, detection and other equipment would also be supplied by Nato members to Ukraine, Nato’s secretary general Jens Stoltenberg confirmed, reflecting western fears that Russia is trying to create “some kind of pretext”. Ukraine map 24 March The alarm grew after Russia began to spread unproven claims this month that Ukraine had been developing a biological weapons programme with the help of the US. This week Biden said such claims were a “clear sign” that Putin was contemplating a biological or chemical assault. The development, production and stockpiling and use of chemical weapons is banned by an international treaty signed by 193 countries, including Russia and the US. Chemical weapons were used on at least 17 occasions during Syria’s civil war, according to the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), which has accused the Russian-backed regime of Bashar al-Assad of being behind several high-profile attacks. Nato leaders are also willing to send more powerful weapons to Ukraine after a plea at the Brussels summit from the country’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, for tanks, rockets and air-defence systems. On Thursday, during a three-hour meeting, the 30 heads of government discussed how they could upgrade and increase their weapons supply – but without provoking Russia to the point where the conflict would lead to a wider war in Europe. Stoltenberg said: “I will not go into the details of the exact type of systems we are deploying … What I can say is that allies do what they can to support Ukraine with weapons.” At the summit, Biden, Johnson and other Nato leaders heard a characteristically passionate call from Zelenskiy for “military assistance – without restrictions”. He asked Nato members to supply more weapons because “Russia uses without restrictions its entire arsenal against us”. 01:12Zelenskiy calls for Nato military aid ‘without restrictions’ for Ukraine – video Zelenskiy specifically asked for anti-missile systems, MLRS rocket artillery, anti-ship weapons, air defence equipment – plus tanks and fighter jets. “You can give us 1% of all your planes, 1% of your tanks,” he said. Russian and Ukrainian activists call for European embargo on Russian fossil fuelsRead more Nato leaders discussed what further weapons could be supplied, given that Ukraine had held out for far longer than expected, and which countries were best placed to supply what arms, western officials said. “There was a discussion both about more [military equipment] in terms of more numbers, and more in terms of different equipment,” one official said. But there are limits; officials indicated they thought it unlikely any Nato country would want to provide tanks, for fear of Russian retaliation. A previous proposal by Poland to transfer 28 MiG-29 jets via the US was rejected by the White House, for similar reasons. “We have a responsibility to prevent this conflict from becoming a full-fledged war in Europe, involving not only Ukraine and Russia, but Nato allies and Russia,” Stoltenberg said in a post-summit press conference. Nato members have largely said they will only provide “defensive equipment”, but Russian military errors and Ukraine’s determination to fight back have left the aggressors struggling to make progress without resorting to heavy bombardment that has left the cities of Mariupol and Kharkiv in ruins. Johnson said the UK would double the number of British missiles sent to Ukraine with an additional 6,000 He also pledged an extra £25m to Ukraine’s military to help it better fight Russia.",,,,

The prime minister said the UK would impose sanctions against the Wagner Group, a paramilitary unit that operates as Putin’s private army, whose mercenaries are reportedly tasked with assassinating the Ukrainian president and other key figures.  “We’ve got to step up, we’ve got to increase our support, we’ve got to tighten the economic vice around Putin, sanctioning more people today as we are sanctioning the Wagner Group,” Johnson told broadcasters before Nato and G7 summits in Brussels on Thursday. 00:54Putin has 'crossed a red line' and should expect reaction from west, says Boris Johnson – video In comments likely to delight Downing Street, the Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, said Johnson had “proved himself the most active participant in the race to be anti-Russian”, according to the RIA news agency. Johnson’s spokesperson said the prime minister was “one of the most active anti-Putin leaders. We have no issue with the Russian people and, in fact, we’ve seen many bravely protest, not least [the imprisoned opposition leader] Alexei Navalny, against Putin’s regime, and call on them to cease this war.” Overnight, the prime minister said the UK would double the number of British missiles sent to Ukraine with an additional 6,000, and send an extra £25m to Ukraine’s military. Officials suggested he would entreat European leaders to rapidly increase lethal aid. Johnson said there were a number of options to further squeeze the Russian economy and aid Ukraine’s defences. “We need to do more, and so we need to do more economically. Can we do more to stop him [Putin] using his gold reserves, for instance, in addition to his cash reserves?” he told LBC. “The more pressure we apply now, particularly on things like gold, I believe the more we can shorten the war … And then we need to do more to give the Ukrainians military support.” Nato countries are expected to agree at Thursday’s emergency summit to provide special kit to protect Ukrainians against any chemical, biological or nuclear attacks launched by Russia. Johnson said he would insist that the siege of Mariupol and the indiscriminate attacks on civilians should be seen as a new escalation, and that the use of chemical or biological weapons should not be the bar set for further punitive measures. Western officials have said the Ukrainians and the Russians are running short of weapons as the conflict grinds on owing to a Ukrainian defence that has been more successful than expected – and that they had anticipated they would be supporting a smaller Ukrainian insurgency by this stage. Johnson said that meant the west had to keep Ukraine supplied with weapons. “The big thing that has emerged in the last month – the huge fact that the world now knows – is that the Ukrainian people will fight for their country,” he said. “That was something we didn’t really know a month ago. We have a duty to help them protect themselves and their loved ones. And so the UK is stepping up again.” Western officials said there must now be a consensus that Russia is pursuing such a “barbaric” strategy in places such as Mariupol that it should be considered to be an escalation in the war, that merits a new response. “The point I’m going to make today is … he’s already crossed a threshold of barbarism in the way he’s behaving,” Johnson said. “People talk about new red lines for chemical, biological, tactical nuclear weapons or whatever. For me the red line already has been crossed.” Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, addressed leaders including the US president, Joe Biden, at the Nato meeting in Brussels on Thursday morning via video link. “You have thousands of fighter jets. But we haven’t been given any yet. We asked for tanks so that we can unblock our cities that are now dying,” he said. “You have at least 20,000 tanks. Ukraine asked for 1% of all your tanks to be given or sold to us, but we do not have a clear answer yet. The worst thing during the war is not having clear answers to requests for help.” Poland is expected to present a proposal at the meeting for a multinational peacekeeping mission in Ukraine, but there is no support from the US or many other allies for a no-fly zone or any other direct Nato intervention, despite the increasingly bloody fighting. One month on: how a tragedy has unfolded in UkraineRead more Nato leaders are also expected on Thursday to agree to increase troop deployments on the alliance’s eastern flank. EU leaders will hold meetings later in the day. Biden will be a guest at the EU summit, but Johnson has not been invited. The other meetings are likely to focus on trying to agree a further toughening of economic sanctions. The UK foreign secretary, Liz Truss, announced a new wave of UK sanctions before the summit, including against defence companies and six new banks. New individuals subjected to sanctions include the founder of Tinkoff bank, Oleg Tinkov; the foreign minister Sergei Lavrov’s stepdaughter Polina Kovaleva, who owns a luxury London apartment; and Galina Danilchenko, installed by Russia as the mayor of Melitopol as part of attempts to create a puppet regime in occupied areas of Ukraine.",,,,

While there, they must discuss and agree on how to respond in the event of further escalation from Russia. In the best case, clarifying Nato’s response to further escalation will deter Vladimir Putin from taking that step. At the very least, it will prepare the allies for what may follow. Having failed to quickly oust the elected government in Kyiv, Putin now faces a choice between negotiating an end to the war, or escalating further. While talks are ongoing, Putin himself has given no indication that he’ll settle for anything less than Ukraine’s complete subjugation. Two weeks ago, CIA director William Burns told Congress that the Russian leader is “likely to double down”. He will “try to grind down the Ukrainian military with no regard for civilian casualties”.  Putin could ramp up the war in many ways – from a deliberate decision to widen the war against Nato, to an attack on allied territory from a stray missile, to using chemical or biological agents or even a nuclear weapon. How should Nato respond to any of these scenarios? A deliberate attack on a member of Nato is unlikely because the allies have made clear they would defend “every inch” of Nato territory. An attack on Nato would mean war – and given the state of its armed forces, it would be a war Russia would be likely to lose. The other forms of escalation would require a more calibrated response. The possibility of a missile hitting Nato territory was underscored when Russia attacked a target just miles from the Polish border. What if the missile had landed in Poland instead? Nato could counter such escalation by taking out the launcher or aircraft that sent the missile. Though risky, such a proportionate response would leave the onus to escalate further on Putin. The use of chemical or biological agents would be a different story. US officials have repeatedly warned that false Russian accusations about Ukrainian chemical weapons and bioweapons labs may constitute a pretext for Moscow to use these weapons and blame Ukraine. How Nato responds should depend on the circumstances. Russia could bomb an industrial chemical or biological research facility and blame the resulting damage on Ukraine. It has already targeted an ammonia storage facility. Other such attacks could cause hundreds or even thousands of casualties, depending on the location, weather, and other conditions. Nato could not let such an escalation go unanswered. At the very least, it should take out the forces responsible for bombing the facilities with surgical strikes. The US, Europe, and other countries would also need to tighten economic sanctions – for example, banning imports of all Russian goods or denying all Russian banks access to the Swift banking system. Moscow, no doubt, would blame any release of chemical or biological agents on Ukraine, and could use those false claims to escalate further. This could include using industrial chemical agents such as chlorine or ammonia to target civilians, as happened repeatedly in Syria, with planes and helicopters dumping barrels full of chemicals on civilians below. Nato would have to respond to such barbarism, for example, by imposing a real no-fly zone to prevent further Russian aerial attacks. Of course, deploying Nato aircraft into a war zone would require attacking Russian aircraft and air defences threatening Nato planes. But that would be an appropriate response to Russia’s deliberate escalation. Though less likely, Russia might decide to use actual chemical weapons (such as mustard gas or sarin nerve agents), biological agents, or even a nuclear weapon. After all, Russian military doctrine foresees the possibility of escalating a conflict to convince the other side to back down. And Putin’s determination to win makes using any of these weapons a conceivable option. Though a Nato response would risk even further escalation, not responding would risk the future credibility of Nato and its capacity to deter. An effective response need not include responding in kind nor require a full-on war against Russia. But if Russia uses chemical or biological agents, let alone a nuclear weapon, Nato should come to the direct defence of Ukraine – deploying its air, ground and naval forces to ensure Russia’s defeat and the full restoration of Ukraine’s independence and sovereignty. No one wants to start world war three. But Putin should know that if he escalates, Nato’s calculation of risks and rewards will change. Letting Moscow know that Nato would come to Ukraine’s direct defence under these circumstances would not only be legal and legitimate, but necessary to demonstrate to Russia and others that escalation does not pay.

The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, called for people around the world to unite in rallies to protest against the war. “Come to your squares, your streets. Make yourselves visible and heard. Say that people matter. Freedom matters. Peace matters. Ukraine matters,” he said.
Western nations will warn Vladimir Putin on Thursday that his country will pay “ruinous” costs for invading Ukraine, during an unprecedented one-day trio of Nato, G7 and EU summits that will be attended by the US president, Joe Biden, in Brussels.
Zelenskiy said he hoped for “meaningful steps” at the round of summits, noting they would reveal “who is a friend, who is a partner, and who betrayed us for money”.
Zelenskiy has addressed the Swedish parliament and told it that Ukraine deserves to be a full member of the European Union.
Seven humanitarian corridors to evacuate civilians from Ukrainian towns and cities have been agreed for Thursday, Ukraine’s deputy prime minister, Iryna Vereshchuk, has said.
Ukraine forces appear to have struck a large Russian landing ship, Orsk, that was unloading supplies at the port of Berdyansk, about 45 miles (75km) from Mariupol. Video footage appears to show a large fire in the port.

The UK government has announced it is applying 65 new sanctions against Russia, “targeting strategic industries, banks and business elites” including the Wagner Group – sometimes described as Vladimir Putin’s private army – and Polina Kovaleva, the stepdaughter of the Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov.
Boris Johnson has said the Russian president has already “crossed a red line” that merits ramping up the west’s response, and that the west could target Russia’s gold reserves.
Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, has said paying for Russian oil and gas in roubles, as Putin is demanding, would be “helping Russians kill Ukrainians”.
Norwegian media is reporting that the Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, is to extend his term in the role by another year because of the war in Ukraine.
Russia has confirmed that at one point Roman Abramovich did play a part in peace talks, but that now “the negotiations are between the two teams”.
Russia’s ambassador to Warsaw has said Poland has blocked the embassy’s bank accounts for allegedly financing “terrorist activity”. Bulgaria is recalling its ambassador from Russia “for consultations”.",,,,

If you’re just joining us, here is a comprehensive rundown on where the crisis currently stands:
Russia and Ukraine exchanged prisoners in the first swap of soldiers since Moscow ordered troops into Ukraine one month ago, Ukraine’s vice-prime minister, Iryna Vereshchuk, said writing the first “full-fledged exchange of prisoners of war took place” where 10 “captured occupiers” were exchanged for 10 Ukrainian servicemen. In a recent update published to her official Telegram channel just before midnight local time, Vereshchuk said the humanitarian hostages taken in Mangush have been released.

Ukraine accused Moscow of forcibly taking hundreds of thousands of civilians from shattered Ukrainian cities to Russia, where some may be used as “hostages” to pressure Kyiv to give up. Lyudmyla Denisova, Ukraine’s ombudsperson, said 402,000 people, including 84,000 children, have been taken against their will. The United Nations told the BBC that Ukrainians are being arbitrarily detained and subjected to enforced disappearances in Russian-controlled areas. 

Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy delivered a powerful late night nation address, suggesting Russia may not have invaded had it known the war would drag on for more than a month. “The 30th day. It’s been a month. Had Russia known that this was expecting them, I’m sure, they would have been scared to come here,” he said. 

US president Joe Biden heads to Warsaw, Poland, today where he is expected to meet with experts on the humanitarian response and US troops stationed in Poland. On Saturday, he is to meet Polish counterpart Andrzej Duda to discuss “the humanitarian and human rights crisis” resulting from the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

The UK’s ministry of defence said Ukraine is striking “high value targets” that is forcing Russian forces to divert resources to defend their supply lines. It cited the attacks on a landing ship and ammunition storage depots at Berdyansk as examples of valuable targets. “It is likely that the Ukrainians will continue to target logistical assets in Russian-held areas. This will force the Russian military to prioritise the defence of their supply chain” and reduce ability to carry out offensive operations.

Ukrainian forces have been bolstered by the destruction of the major Russian landing ship as it brought in supplies to its troops. Dramatic pictures showed billowing fire and black smoke as the Orsk, docked in Berdyansk on the Azov Sea, was hit by Ukrainian ballistic missiles.

The Ukrainian defence ministry said its troops had pushed back Russian forces from some areas around the capital, Kyiv. Russian troops did not have enough resources to push ahead with their offensive in Ukraine, Oleksander Motuzyanyk, Ukraine’s defence ministry spokesperson said.

These accounts appear to be corroborated by a senior Pentagon official who said Russia is running out of precision guided munitions and it is more likely to rely on so-called dumb bombs and artillery. Under Secretary of Defense for Policy Colin Kahl said Russia is suffering high failure rates as high as 60% for some of its precision-guided missiles while its forces have taken heavy casualties and are low on supplies.

Ukraine’s deputy prime minister said there were 40 buses waiting to take civilians out of Mariupol, but that Russian forces were not letting them through. There were meant to be seven humanitarian corridors open on Thursday – although Mariupol was not included among them.

Ukraine has accused Moscow of forcibly taking 402,000 civilians, including 84,000 children, from Ukrainian cities to Russia - and raised concerns that they would be used as hostages. Russia corroborated the numbers but said the civilians has been evacuated willingly.

Nato leaders have agreed to strengthen their defences in the east in response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. About 40,000 troops have been placed on its eastern flank along with significant air and naval assets, and four new battlegroups will be sent to Slovakia, Hungary, Bulgaria and Romania.

The US and its allies announced new sanctions on more than 400 Russian elites and institutions. Among those sanctioned were Russia’s lower house of parliament, the Duma, and 328 of its members. The US treasury department also issued guidance, warning that US authorities may impose sanctions on gold-related transactions involving Russia.

Biden said China understands the economic consequences that would ensue if it provides help to Russia in its war with Ukraine and understands that its economic future is “much more closely tied to the west than it is to Russia”. The US Under Secretary of Defense for Policy Colin Kahl also said Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has made it more of a strategic burden on China.

G7 leaders said they are resolved to impose severe consequences on Russia and stand ready to apply additional measures “as required”. In a joint statement, they condemned Vladimir Putin’s “war of choice” and his “unjustifiable, unprovoked and illegal” aggression in Ukraine.

The Biden administration and the European Union are expected to announce a major initiative to direct shipments of liquefied natural gas to Europe during the US president’s visit to Brussels this week, the Washington Post reported, citing three US officials familiar with the plan.

Russia has been hit with 65 new sanctions by the UK, in a move the Foreign Office said was designed to target “key strategic industries and individuals”. Among those hit were six banks and a defence company that produces drones, as well as the Wagner Group, which Britain said had reportedly been tasked with assassinating the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy.

The UK and allies will “ramp up” lethal aid to Ukraine, Boris Johnson said following a meeting of G7 leaders. The UK will send an additional 6,000 missiles and provide £25m in funding for Ukraine’s armed forces, he said, with kit provided “in the quantity and with the quality” needed by Ukraine to defend itself against “its bullying neighbour”.

Asked about the Kremlin’s claim that he was the “most active participant in the race to be anti-Russian”, Boris Johnson said he was not “remotely anti-Russian”. “I think I’m probably the only prime minister in UK history to be called Boris,” he told reporters in Brussels.

The United Nations general assembly voted overwhelmingly to call on Russia to stop its war on Ukraine immediately and to provide more aid access and civilian protection in Ukraine. The resolution received 140 votes in favour and five votes against - Russia, Syria, North Korea, Eritrea and Belarus - while 38 countries abstained.

He told the council:You blocked Nord Stream 2. We are grateful to you. And rightly so. But it was also a little late. Because if it had been in time, Russia would not have created a gas crisis. At least there was a chance.
The Russian military does not see what dignity is. They do not know what conscience is. They do not understand why we value our freedom so much. This is what determines how the country will live.”He said Russia has already destroyed 230 schools, 155 kindergartens and killed 128 children in Ukraine. Whole cities, villages. Just to ashes. Nothing remains.

This, sorry, can never happen. It can never happen,” US Ambassador Ken Salazar said in remarks at Mexico’s lower house of Congress on Thursday, as reported by Reuters. “We have to be in solidarity with Ukraine and against Russia,” he said, before invoking the history of World War II.“I remember very well that during the Second World War there was no distance between Mexico and the United States, both were united against what Hitler was doing,” he added.Salazar’s comments came after Russia’s ambassador to Mexico, Viktor Koronelli, addressed lawmakers at a newly inaugurated “Mexico-Russia friendship committee” on Wednesday.“On the orders of Uncle Sam, Mexico will never answer ‘Yes, Sir’” Koronelli said, drawing applause from some legislators. 25 Mar 202202.49Ukraine’s general staff of the armed forces has released its latest intelligence report as of 10pm local time.Russia’s attempt to encircle the city of Kyiv has not been fulfilled while attempts to block Chernihiv have also been unsuccessful, officials claimed. “[Russia] will try to resume offensive operations in the direction of the cities of Brovary and Boryspil in order to block the capital of Ukraine, the city of Kyiv, from the east,” the report reads. Russian troops are also blocking the cities of Sumy and Kharkiv and striking civilian infrastructure, officials said.The withdrawal of some Russian units is due to “the loss of more than 50% of the personnel” Ukraine’s armed forces claim.

Nor had the chief of the general staff of Russia’s armed forces, Valery Gerasimov.Rumours were beginning to circulate that they may have been punished over the bungled invasion, which has failed to capture key Ukrainian cities such as Kharkiv or Kyiv and plunged Russia into economic isolation.Russians had already watched Putin browbeat and humiliate the head of the country’s foreign intelligence service, Sergei Naryshkin, during a televised meeting over the fate of the Russian-controlled territories in eastern Ukraine.Journalists have since filed reports on an investigation in the FSB directorate responsible for foreign intelligence, including on Ukraine, and on the arrest of a senior official from Russia’s national guard.It is unclear if any of those events are related to Russia’s war in Ukraine, an effort that is going according to plan, a Russian foreign ministry official said on Thursday. For many Russians, however, it is apparent that the war is not going to plan, and the expectation among Kremlin watchers is that men such as Shoigu could shoulder the blame.Russian defence minister resurfaces on TV – but for just a few secondsRead more 25 Mar 202201.50Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has made it more of a strategic burden on China, the US Under Secretary of Defense for Policy Colin Kahl has said.I do think that there’s a degree to which what Putin has done in Ukraine makes Russia much more of a strategic burden for Beijing than it was six weeks ago or six months ago.”In February, China and Russia declared a “no limits” partnership, backing each other over standoffs on Ukraine and Taiwan with a promise to collaborate more against the West. 25 Mar 202201.26We have a little more detail on earlier statements made by a senior Pentagon official, claiming Russia will emerge from the conflict in Ukraine weaker and more isolated.Under Secretary of Defense for Policy Colin Kahl said:I think with a high degree of certainty that Russia will emerge from Ukraine weaker than it went into the conflict.

In the Donetsk region, she said 2,717 residents from Mariupol were able to evacuate to Zaporozhye however Russian forces have continued to block humanitarian aid from entering the city. For 3 days the occupiers have not given permission for the convoy with humanitarian cargo to enter the city,” she said.Service members of pro-Russian troops drive armoured vehicles past local residents in the besieged southern port city of Mariupol, Ukraine.

Humanitarian aid was also delivered to the city.While it was not possible to evacuate anyone from Melitopol, a convoy with humanitarian aid reached the city and will continue to deliver supplies on Friday.In the Kyiv region, 509 people from Velyka Dymerka, Bohdanivka and Bervytsia were evacuated to Brovary, she added.Vereshchuk said officials are continuing to work for the release of Ukrainian citizens, including border guards and civilians from Snake Island, as well as abducted local government employees.“In recent days, we have received many reports from people who managed to escape from the captivity of the occupiers about mass cases of torture of prisoners,” she alleged.

It is not a task many thought Biden would so firmly take on when he took office in 2021. Initially, Biden focused on healing domestic wounds following four chaotic years of the Trump administration and the emergence of the Covid-19 pandemic.  But Biden’s speech in Poland appeared designed to signal a shift in US policy and a generational call to arms for democratic countries to unite against autocracy in a years-long foreign policy project, with the US at its head. Biden: ‘butcher’ Putin cannot be allowed to stay in powerRead more “In this battle, we need to be clear eyed,” said Biden. “This battle will not be won in days or months, either. We need to steel ourselves for the long fight ahead.” That unity, Biden signaled, would need to include democracies that have at times been at odds with one another. The sweeping speech ended with a call for “a different future, a brighter future rooted in democracy and principle, hope and light”. The president used the speech to draw historical parallels between the war in Ukraine, which began a month ago when Russian forces invaded, to the second world war; moments symbolic of freedom including the fall of the Berlin Wall; and the words of Pope John Paul II, who was Polish and who told the world: “Be not afraid.” In its sweep and scope, the speech had echoes of other major foreign policy addresses given by US presidents on European soil, such as Ronald Reagan’s “tear down this wall” speech in Berlin in 1987 and John F Kennedy’s Ich bin ein Berliner call in 1963. “All of us, including here in Poland, must do the hard work of democracy each and every day – in my country as well. That’s why I came to Europe again this week,” said Biden. “For all freedom-loving nations, we must commit now to be in this fight for the long haul.” Biden highlighted the US commitment to Ukraine and Nato, including a pledge to defend “every inch of Nato territory with the full force of our collective power”. The US and allies “maintain absolute unity – we must, among the world’s democracies”, he said. Biden meets with Ukrainian refugees and humanitarian aid workers during a visit to PGE Narodowy Stadium in Warsaw on Saturday. Photograph: Evan Vucci/AP “This is the task of our time. The task of this generation,” the president said about the fight against autocracy. The speech was a far cry from one of Biden’s earliest foreign policy decisions – to follow through with the withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan after 20 years of war. In August 2021, the administration began an urgent evacuation of Americans and Afghan allies, after the capital, Kabul, fell to the Taliban in a matter of days. Russia’s invasion crystallises divide between west and rest of worldRead more “I was not going to extend this forever war, and I was not extending a forever exit,” Biden said in August 2021. Biden also used the speech to highlight commitments he said showed “the people of Ukraine can count on the United States”, including accepting 100,000 refugees and providing $300m in humanitarian aid and thousands of tons of food, water and medicine. Biden called Vladimir Putin a “tyrant” and appealed directly to the Russian people. He invoked the struggles of the second world war, including the siege of Leningrad, which would be “fresh in the memory of many grandparents”. “You, the Russian people, are not our enemy,” said Biden. “I refuse to believe you welcome the killing of innocent children and grandparents, or that you accept hospitals, schools, maternity wards – for God’s sake – being pummeled with Russian missiles and bombs.” “These are not memories past,” said Biden. “This is exactly what the Russian army is doing to Ukraine right now.”",,,,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/730e8dad4e9bb56ffd26882a6b3e52c872a6b9fb/0_87_3299_1979/master/3299.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=094fd7e18fd4a6298c562d7e89d56cc6

However, a White House official said soon after the speech that Biden was not calling for regime change in Russia.  Russia had been quick to respond to Biden’s initial comment, with Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov saying: “This [Putin remaining in power] is not to be decided by Mr Biden. It should only be a choice of the people of the Russian Federation.” Biden offers further military support to Ukraine as Russian troops falterRead more Earlier in the speech, Biden had said the world must prepare for a “long fight ahead”, as he painted the war as part of a generation-spanning defence of universal democratic principles against a Russian order “governed by brute force”. “We emerged anew in the great battle for freedom,” the American leader said at his speech at the Polish presidential palace. “The battle between democracy and autocracy. Between liberty and repression. Between a rules-based order and one governed by brute force. “This battle will not be won in days or months,. We need to steel ourselves for a long fight ahead.” Just before Biden started his speech, Russian cruise missiles hit targets in the city of Lviv near Ukraine’s western border, about 400km (250 miles) from where the US president was speaking. Referencing Pope John Paul II’s “be not afraid” speech of 1979 at the beginning and end, Biden’s speech linked the war in Ukraine with historic moments of eastern European defiance against Soviet aggression. “The battle for democracy did not conclude with the fall of the Berlin Wall,” Biden said. “Today Russia has strangled democracy and sought to do so elsewhere, not just in its homeland.” He explicitly warned Russia of extending its war into Nato territory. “Don’t even think about moving one inch on to Nato territory,” Biden said. “The west is now more united than it has ever been.” Earlier in the day, Biden had emphasised the “sacred” tie of the Nato military alliance that binds several nations neighbouring Ukraine to the US. “We take article 5 as a sacred commitment,” the president told his Polish counterpart, Andrzej Duda, in Warsaw on Saturday. “Not a throwaway. A sacred commitment that relates to every member of Nato.” “I’m confident that Vladimir Putin was counting on being able to divide NATO, to separate the eastern flank from the west, to separate nations based on past histories. But he hasn’t been able to do it. We’ve all stayed together. And it is so important that we keep in lockstep,” Biden said. Biden’s motorcade had arrived at the presidential palace in Warsaw at about 12:30am, after a short ride down a street lined with Polish and Ukrainian flags. Members of the Polish forces representing different branches of the military awaited the American leader in ceremonial uniforms. About an hour earlier Biden, his foreign secretary, Antony Blinken, and defence secretary Lloyd Austin had held a brief meeting with Ukrainian counterparts including foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba and defence chief Oleksii Reznikov at the Marriott hotel in central Warsaw. At Stadion Narodowy, a football stadium converted into a refugee centre, Biden also met a number of people who have fled across the border into Poland to escape the bloodshed in Ukraine, as well as volunteers working to providing them with meals. Asked by reporters what seeing Ukrainian refugees at Stadion Narodowy made him think of as he deals with Vladimir Putin, Biden responded: “He’s a butcher.” 3.5 million Ukrainians have fled their country since the start of the war, of which an estimated 2.2 million have found shelter in Poland, whose conservative government’s welcoming stance has contrasted starkly to its reluctance to take in those fleeing the war in Syria six years ago. “We do not want to call them refugees,” said Polish president Duda, of the national-conservative Law and Justice party, on Saturday. “They are our guests, our brothers, our neighbours from Ukraine, who today are in a very difficult situation.” On Friday, Biden had flown into the Polish town of Rzeszów, about an hour’s drive from the Ukrainian border, where he got a first-hand look at international efforts to help more than 2 million Ukrainian refugees who have found temporary shelter in Poland from the war in their country, and met US troops bolstering Nato’s eastern flank. Over the past several months the US has bolstered European allies with the temporary deployment of thousands of additional troops to Poland, Germany and Romania. After some strains in its relationships with the US and the EU in recent years, Poland – which already hosted numerous US and Nato military bases and is a cornerstone of Nato’s eastern front – is enjoying a centre-stage position. The US and Poland have sometimes disagreed about the best way to support Ukraine. Earlier this month the US rejected a Polish proposal to send Soviet-era MiG fighter planes to Ukraine via US bases, which the White House viewed as too potentially escalatory. Similarly, when Jarosław Kaczyński – a Polish politician considered even more influential than President Duda – recently suggested that Nato deploy a peacekeeping force to Ukraine, Washington quickly and quietly swept the idea off the table.",,,,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a94e60bfd5feff25eda53b0e1e9a5312330dc1cf/0_144_4318_2591/master/4318.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=168a51ea3f51f4e706117eca1244f077

Internal applicants welcome,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/mar/26/wanted-russian-revolution-to-topple-tyrant-putin-internal-applicants-welcome,"Openly acknowledged or not, regime change in Moscow – meaning the overthrow of Vladimir Putin – must be the western democracies’ ultimate objective as they help to thwart his conquest of Ukraine. Pursuing imperial fantasies, a tsar-like Putin has gone too far this time. Now he’s got to go. Urgently required: a new Russian revolution to topple the tyrant, led from within and assisted from without. The idea of Putin remaining in power, even if a Ukraine settlement is eventually patched together, is both impractical and obscene. By his inhuman actions, Russia’s dictator has placed himself beyond the pale. He’s a menace to universal order, an affront to common decency. He simply cannot be trusted.  Despite resounding international condemnation, the damaging impact of western sanctions on Russia’s people, the resulting threat to global food and energy supplies, and daily evidence that his ill-led armed forces are in deep trouble, Putin appears determined to fight on, even to escalate. Last week’s disappointing Nato summit will have done little to dissuade him. US president Joe Biden warns this blind fanaticism could bring on a death struggle, leading to Russian use of chemical, biological or even battlefield nuclear weapons. The Kremlin does not rule it out. Such crude blackmail is no basis for any kind of sane relationship. Washington has now formally accused Russia of war crimes, for which Putin bears command responsibility, and vowed to bring him to justice. The UN’s highest court has ordered him to stop. Biden deems him a “war criminal” and a “pure thug”. Who, in their hearts, honestly disagrees? Even his Chinese chums look askance. For as long as he holds power, Putin will pose a potentially existential threat to the security of Europe and the wider world. His contempt for human life, rights, international law and the UN charter disqualify him from any future leadership role. For who can doubt the Ukraine war would halt if he were unseated? There will be no peace while Putin’s around. He’s unfit. He’s an outlaw. He’s a second Bashar al-Assad. He must fall. Logically, practically and morally speaking, the US and its allies have no alternative but to actively seek his overthrow. They cannot directly intervene in Russia. But they can and should make it plain to Russia’s elites and wider public that Putin is a liability, a deadweight and a danger, primarily to them – and that the west will back them if they move against him. People often say revolution will never happen. But they said that about Nicolae Ceaușescu, Erich Honecker, Hosni Mubarak, Ferdinand Marcos, Anastasio Somoza,the Shah of Iran – and Tsar Nicholas II. So maybe they’re wrong about Putin too. There’s good reason to believe all those billionaire oligarchs, state industry bosses, sycophantic Duma politicians, braided generals and Oblomov-like bureaucrats who have done well under Putin are having second thoughts now as sanctions bite, assets freeze, foreign travel halts, houses and yachts are seized, and the rouble crashes. Its governing class has much to lose as Russia hurtles into recession and isolation – and it’s showing. Bypassed Kremlin insiders and FSB spooks are reportedly seething with anger. Putin’s bumbling defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, and army chief of staff have disappeared from view. A senior envoy, Anatoly Chubais, jumped ship last week. Meanwhile, Ukraine reports 1917-style desertions by Russia’s demoralised frontline troops. No amount of regime propaganda can hide Russians' new daily reality of food queues, rising prices, medical shortages and closed banks As for the long-suffering, much-bamboozled Russian people, no amount of regime propaganda can hide their new daily reality of food queues, rising prices, medical shortages and closed banks. Thousands have demonstrated against the invasion, braving police brutality. Thousands more young professionals – Russia’s future – are moving abroad as paranoid Putin rails against a traitorous “fifth column”. The longer the war, the higher the casualties and costs, the more public anger may be directed at Putin. The west should increase the pressure and facilitate his demolition through tighter, deeper sanctions (including, crucially, on energy exports), offensive military aid to Kyiv and expanded broadcast and social media information campaigns inside Russia. Any future leader seems most likely to come from within the Kremlin apparatus. A transitional figure could emerge in much the same way as did Putin himself in the dying days of Boris Yeltsin’s presidency. At the other end of the opposition spectrum, the always defiant Alexei Navalny is a potent rallying force. The toppling of Putin may prove a long-term aspiration or could happen very quickly. Historically, change in Russia often occurs abruptly. The hope would be for a subsequent move to free, democratic elections. Yet what happens ultimately depends on Russians themselves. To maximise the chances of success, the western powers should consider all overt and covert methods of encouraging new leadership, including political incentives, security guarantees and perhaps even a “money back” scheme for repentant oligarchs. If appeals to principle do not work, appeals to self-interest may. EU and Nato members must agree, too, that Putin is not someone they can ever do business with again. Let’s hope France and Germany get the message. Liz Truss, Britain’s foreign secretary, is concerned they may let Putin off the hook by offering a revised, Minsk-type compromise over the Ukrainians’ heads, similar to their failed Crimea initiative. Meanwhile, backsliding, fence-sitting, ostensibly pro-western governments in Israel, India, Turkey, Saudi Arabia and the UAE that refuse to sanction Russia, must be firmly reminded who their real friends are – and how their interests are best served. It’s not by sucking up to a war criminal. It’s not by rationalising or minimising an unprovoked war of aggression against a sovereign democracy. It’s by doing all they can to help Russians and their friends in the west bring Putin’s murderous reign to an end. As Bolshevik revolutionaries once cried, so must Russia’s people cry again: “Peace! Land! Bread!”",,,,

Photograph: Reuters,Vladimir Putin,"Saturday, 26 March 2022",2022-03-26,Could Russia use chemical weapons in Ukraine and how would west respond?,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/26/could-russia-use-chemical-weapons-in-ukraine-and-how-would-west-respond,"Joe Biden was asked twice in a press conference on Thursday if Nato would respond with military action were Russia were to use chemical weapons in Ukraine, a fear raised repeatedly over the past few weeks by the US, UK and others. Could Russia use chemical weapons in Ukraine?  Russia is one of 193 countries that have signed an international treaty banning the production, stockpiling and use of chemical weapons – and Moscow denies having or using such weapons. However, Russian agents used a deadly nerve agent, novichok, in Salisbury in 2018, killing a woman. It was used again by agents to poison the opposition leader Alexei Navalny in August 2020. Investigative journalists believe Russia retains a covert chemical weapons programme, while its ally, Syria, is accused of repeatedly using a range of chemical weapons during the long-running civil war there. Western leaders have become concerned that Russia’s failure to achieve a quick victory in Ukraine means it could consider escalating the weapons it uses to avoid bloody urban warfare, which favours the defenders. Helicopters dropping chlorine gas in residential areas of Aleppo in November and December 2016 led to the end of rebel resistance in the Syrian city after four years of fighting. “These weapons are morbidly effective and can break the will of civilians to resist,” said the chemical weapons expert Hamish de Bretton-Gordon. How did Biden reply to questions about possibility of Russia using chemical weapons? “We would respond,” Biden said in his first answer. “We would respond if he uses it. The nature of the response would depend on the nature of the use.” The second answer was less clearly expressed. “It would trigger a response in kind. Whether or not – you’re asking whether Nato would cross – we’d make that decision at the time.” It was clear from the context that a “response in kind” was intended to mean it would be a considered reaction to what was deemed to have taken place. Military action was by no means certain – although Biden was careful not to rule it out either. What could a Nato response look like? Biden’s answer was clearly conditional on what any attack would look like. De Bretton-Gordon argues there are two possible types of Russian attack: a chlorine or ammonia attack, which the Kremlin would could try to dress up as an industrial accident, and the use of chemical weapons specifically designed to kill such as sarin, which was used in Syria in 2017, or novichok. “In the first instance, I am not sure there would be a kinetic [military] response from Nato – allies would more likely want to supply Ukraine with more and better weaponry and extra intelligence if they can. But if Russia used agents only designed for use in warfare, Nato would likely have to respond militarily as they did in Syria,” said de Bretton-Gordon, also a former commander of Nato’s chemical weapons force. The US engaged in two sets of strikes in Syria. Missile strikes took place in April 2017, after the sarin gas attack. Air and missile attacks followed year later in April 2018, with the help of France and the UK, after a chlorine gas was used in Damascus. Each time what were described as Syrian chemical weapons sites were targeted. But any attack by Nato forces, or a subset of western countries, would be very unlikely to attack chemical sites in Russia directly for fear of starting a general war, which Nato members agree they want to avoid. The reality of Russia’s ability to strike back against the west may well make a military response impossible. Are there non-military alternatives? Potentially, although nobody knows what Russia’s red lines are. Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy made a direct appeal at Thursday’s Nato summit for more higher specification arms, fighter jets, tanks, rocket artillery and air defence systems. Western nations could step up military aid. A second option would be to tighten economic sanctions further, using the illegality of chemical weapons as justification. Options would include sanctions against other Russian banks and a full ban by the EU and the UK on oil and gas imports, although that would be, for some countries, an economically difficult decision to take. Western leaders say they want to preserve “a bit of ambiguity” in any response, as the UK prime minister, Boris Johnson, said on Thursday. But the reality is that serious discussions will only take place after any chemical weapons attack.",,,,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8f60c2516a4185c19d1b3829a0398cbe443efbb6/730_68_2192_1316/master/2192.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=b97dbe39c0278c90e29856b86c4f034d

Martin Kimani cited his country’s own history as he warned against irredentism and expansionism: “We must complete our recovery from the embers of dead empires in a way that does not plunge us back into new forms of domination and oppression,” he said. On two general assembly resolutions – the first denouncing the invasion, the second blaming Russia for creating a humanitarian crisis – 140 or more nations have approved. Only four have voted with Russia to oppose them: a rogues’ gallery of Belarus, Eritrea, Syria and North Korea. Yet widespread condemnation, along with the west’s unexpected unity, should not be mistaken for Russian isolation. Having boasted of a relationship with “no limits”, and sharing a common interest in countering the global might of the US and Nato, China is now seeking to portray itself in a more nuanced light and avoid economic and political damage – but is not, in reality, distancing itself from Russia. Beijing is not alone. Few of the world’s most populous nations, and only a few leading players outside the west, have assailed Mr Putin.  Imran Khan, Pakistan’s prime minister, was in Moscow as the tanks rolled into Ukraine. India, which has a longstanding strategic relationship with Russia and high anxiety about its ties to both Pakistan and China, has discussed a “rouble-rupee” swap to help Moscow beat western sanctions. In Brazil, Jair Bolsonaro – courted by Mr Putin – even sees the war as a “good opportunity” to encroach on indigenous land in search of materials for fertiliser. Russia’s influence in and dealings with the Middle East have expanded substantially since its decisive role in the Syrian war, leaving many countries hedging their bets, in the midst of a broader realignment of the region. Saudi Arabia’s crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, recently refused to take Joe Biden’s call – a week after speaking to Vladimir Putin. The UAE said no to a call too. It voted against Russia at the UN general assembly, where votes are non-binding and largely symbolic, but abstained in a similar vote at the security council, which would have had more weight. South Africa initially called for the withdrawal of Russian troops, but then blamed Nato expansion for the war. Sixteen other African nations joined it in abstaining in the first general assembly vote thanks to growing economic ties, as well as a long-established position of non-alignment and the Soviet Union’s support for liberation movements. The war has triggered, not caused, a dramatic new phase in the long-term reshaping of our world. Trumpism has done more than China’s growing might to accelerate perceptions of US decline. Selective compassion and double standards have increased suspicion and rancour. Another illegal war – Iraq – looms largest. But many also note the contrast between the welcome outpouring of concern for Ukrainian refugees in Europe and widespread indifference or hostility to those fleeing other wars. Russia’s use of cluster munitions is rightly condemned, but Mr Biden has yet to reverse his predecessor’s decision to axe a ban on their use. Kenya’s righteous criticism of Russia’s aggression came with a pointed addendum: a condemnation of “the trend in the last few decades of powerful states, including members of this security council, breaching international law with little regard”. Mr Putin’s current position reflects not only his willingness to aid unsavoury regimes, and his malign interference around the world, but also the sins and failures of the US and the west. To address these is not a hopelessly idealistic endeavour, but one of necessary realism, if we are to forge the powerful alliances needed against cruel acts of aggression.",/p/y5gk8,350,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/mar/27/the-guardian-view-on-putin-and-the-world-its-not-just-about-china#comments,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c6f4decbf689c6cff0457eabe8ea0c2e98bef795/0_252_2841_1704/master/2841.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=3ea8abc5e9e289bc6d85e159d20a09d7

More than a few senior figures in the British and other western governments shared his assumption that Russian forces possessed the numerical and technological superiority to prevail, and swiftly. It was widely thought that by now we would be looking at a subjugated Ukraine while a triumphant Putin taunted the west to do anything about it. Belligerent autocrats the world over would have been encouraged to believe that tomorrow belongs to dictatorships and the liberal democracies would never have looked so feeble. The decline of the west would no longer be a contentious draft of the history of the early 21st century. It would be more like a bitter fact. So when the leaders of Nato, the EU and the G7 recently gathered in Brussels, one of the strongest emotions was sheer relief that the Russian invasion has not gone to Putin’s plan. Only a minority of the credit for that belongs to western leaders, too many of whom were slow to supply the Ukrainians with the means to defend themselves and some of whom are still not rising to the gravity of the moment. The failure of Putin’s gamble is down to Russian military incompetence making contact with heroic, fierce and skilful Ukrainian resistance. In the early days of the conflict, the White House thought it so unlikely that Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s government could survive that it offered an escape route to save him from capture by the Russians. His response was the magnificently scornful “I need ammunition, not a ride”. The inspirational example of the Ukrainian leader and his defiant people has played a vital role in rallying and unifying the west.  We have to avoid getting sucked into an all-out war between Russia and Nato, because we have no idea how that might endJeremy Hunt Another big factor is guilt. There is necessary shame among the democracies that Putin was emboldened to invade by the puny responses to his earlier aggressions. It wasn’t wrong to encourage Ukraine’s aspirations to join Nato. The mistake was not to satisfy them. That left Ukraine stranded in a dangerously ambiguous place, called “one of us” by the west but denied the protection of Nato’s nuclear umbrella, an exposed position that did not contain Russian aggression but amplified it. Along with the spasms of guilt and gasps of relief, there is also self-congratulation in western capitals that the democracies are displaying a resolve many doubted they could muster. Nato’s eastern flank is being reinforced. Finland and Sweden are debating whether to join the alliance, a window of opportunity they might be wise to leap through while Putin is preoccupied. Georgia and Moldova have applied to join the EU, which has managed to park some of its internal quarrels to concentrate on the external threat. The Swiss have put aside their neutrality to join the freezing of Russian assets. Even the ineffable silliness of Boris Johnson, who just couldn’t stop himself making a tasteless and ludicrous comparison between Brexit and Ukraine’s mortal struggle for freedom, hasn’t spoilt the mood. The most remarkable sight has been to witness Germany waking from its long slumber. During the Nato operation to prevent ethnic cleansing by the Serbian dictator Slobodan Milošević in the late 1990s, Gerhard Schröder told Tony Blair that Germany would never participate in military action because his country had become “essentially pacifist”. No longer. Under Olaf Scholz, Europe’s mightiest economic power has committed itself to a huge programme of rearmament – and pollsters report that three-quarters of the German public embrace the ambition. Yet question marks still hover over the democracies and their commitment to ensuring that Putin is defeated. The most pressing is about the scope and scale of the resources that Nato is prepared to commit to the defence of freedom. On this subject, President Zelenskiy is too eloquent for the comfort of many western leaders. When he addressed the Nato summit, he made a characteristically passionate appeal for “military assistance – without restrictions”, asking for the alliance to supply a tiny fraction of its military hardware: “You can give us 1% of your planes, 1% of your tanks.” Some contend that an excess of caution is handing Putin an advantage that he can and should be denied This tugged on a significant rift between Nato members and within Nato governments. Some, notably the Americans and the French, are happy for the Ukrainians to receive defensive weaponry, such as anti-tank and anti-aircraft missiles, but balk at warplanes and armour. They fear travelling a road that might lead towards escalation and even Armageddon. Sources report that Joe Biden personally nixed Poland’s proposal to reinforce the Ukrainians with MiG-29 fighters. This restraint has the sympathy of some senior Tories, including the former foreign secretary Jeremy Hunt. He tells me: “The truth is we do have to stop ourselves getting sucked into an all-out war between Russia and Nato, because we have no idea how that might end.” Others contend that an excess of caution is handing Putin an advantage that he can and should be denied. Tobias Ellwood, the former soldier who chairs the Commons select committee on defence, argues that it is militarily and morally wrong to “leave the Ukrainians to do all the heavy lifting by themselves” while Nato’s “colossal firepower” is left “sitting on the bench”. The longer the war goes on – and especially if disgusted western voters put more pressure on their governments to respond to Russian war crimes – the more heated this argument will become. Russia is now a pariah state with a siege economy. Sanctions are hurting, but Putin is not being punished as severely as he could be, because western countries are still buying his hydrocarbons. Russia is banking $700m a day from European states for natural gas alone. This keeps the Kremlin solvent, finances its war machine and will be interpreted in Moscow as a sign that the west is not as fully committed to the fight for freedom as it claims to be. The selfish case for not imposing a comprehensive ban on Russian exports is that it will inflict discomfort on western consumers until alternative energy sources are available. The tactical case is that this sanction is a big bazooka best kept in reserve to deter Putin from an escalation of atrocities, such as using chemical or biological weapons. We know from his indiscriminate blitzing of major cities that he is utterly indifferent to the slaughter of civilians. Like Macbeth, he may tell himself “I am in blood stepped in so far that should I wade no more, returning were as tedious as go o’er”. He has already committed so much murder that his next gamble may be that he has nothing to lose from perpetrating even fouler acts. Should that happen, there will be an unanswerable case for tightening the economic blockade of Russia to maximum. Confronted with so much loss and devastation, it is natural to try to find solace in optimistic conjectures about how this war could end. This has been encouraged by battlefield deaths of senior Russian officers, the disappearance of key figures around Putin and reports of mutiny in his army’s ranks. The hope is that casualties and demoralisation on the Russian side will mount to the point that Putin is compelled to call it quits, withdraw his forces and try to dress up humiliation as some kind of victory. The dreamiest “dream scenario” is a putsch in Moscow. Putin contracts what was known in the cold war era as “Kremlin flu”. He goes away and never comes back – unless it is to face a war crimes trial at The Hague. Western governments do discuss the chances of a Kremlin coup. “It’s not impossible,” says Sir David Lidington, the former de facto deputy prime minister and now chairman of the Royal United Services Institute. Russia has often surprised us. Western intelligence agencies didn’t anticipate the toppling of Nikita Krushchev in the wake of the Cuban missile crisis or the coup against Mikhail Gorbachev that triggered the collapse of the Soviet Union. We cannot entirely rule out the dethroning of Putin. But, as Sir David also says, nor should we be counting on it. It will be a major error to overinvest in scenarios that may turn out to be false. Western governments can hope for the best, but they must prepare themselves and their peoples for a protracted and testing conflict.

President Joe Biden, a self-proclaimed “gaffe machine”, did not fail to deliver at the weekend by declaring that the Russian leader, Vladimir Putin, “cannot remain in power”. A Freudian slip, perhaps, from a US president who has already called Mr Putin a “butcher” and a “murderous dictator”. But regime change in Russia is not official US policy – and nor should it be, given the nuclear, chemical and biological weapons Mr Putin possesses. The uproar caused by Mr Biden’s comment led to it being walked back by the White House. This was the mature and correct way for Washington to proceed. Mr Biden had made the unfortunate comment on the eve of peace talks between Russia and Ukraine. Progress has been slow. But the US president’s statement threatened to bring negotiations to a halt. If Mr Biden’s words had not been withdrawn, Mr Putin’s worst fears – that the US wanted him gone – would be confirmed. The Russian president, who has hitherto shown no restraint, would have no reason to compromise, with everything to lose.  The Roman statesman Cicero thought that the purpose of war was peace. The Ukrainian army has bravely fought Russian forces to a standstill, but cannot retake the ground it has lost. Mr Putin’s blitzkrieg to topple the Kyiv government failed. There’s no end in sight for the first major European conflict this century. Ukraine is fighting a just war of self-defence. Russia is engaged in an unjust war of aggression. Cicero believed that “an unjust peace is better than a just war”. But terms of peace that were too favourable to Russia would simply be an agreement for further fighting. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has adopted a twin-track strategy to deal with Moscow. He is softening his diplomatic position – telling Russian journalists that Ukraine could be neutral and compromise over the status of the eastern Donbas region as part of a peace deal – while hardening his military position by calling for more tanks, missiles and even fighter jets from Nato. Mr Zelenskiy wants to secure as much sovereignty and autonomy as possible. He deserves our support. Mr Putin does not appear to be taking the talks anywhere near as seriously as Ukraine is. This might explain Mr Zelenskiy’s call for a face-to-face meeting with Mr Putin. The Russian president does not want to be seen to lose. Mr Putin has become drunk on his success in extending his influence across the former Soviet republics and in the Middle East. Yet his immoral and illegal war in Ukraine has galvanised Nato and united the EU. Mr Putin has made real what he most feared: a Ukraine proudly distinct from Russia in which liberals and nationalists have found common cause. Kyiv and Moscow are likely to have to settle for less than they want. Ukraine is an imperfect democracy, but one able to negotiate legitimate political outcomes without violence and within the rule of law. This cannot be said of Russia under Mr Putin. Underlying Mr Biden’s gaffe was a truth that Russia’s president cannot be trusted to honour a peace deal. Nor can his criminal invasion be rewarded. However, only Russians can remove Mr Putin from the negotiations – and their country’s history is not without civil uprisings precipitated by unpopular wars.",,,,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/117137d0618c2a9db9d41a881f88a2fb59d1dd85/0_117_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=8ac20e1a91e1074e2bb0b953428a3f0c

He’s playing into Putin’s hands,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/mar/28/biden-diplomatic-liability-putin-hands,"An iron maxim of war is to imagine what your enemy most wants you to do, and not to do it. Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine is floundering. He has lied to the Russian people to justify it. He has told them it is not Ukraine but Nato and the west that seek their defeat and his overthrow. That is why they must support him in his fight. To a large extent they have done so. Nato has so far been scrupulous in not playing Putin’s game. It has stood aloof from active military support to Ukraine’s President Zelenskiy, as have its individual member countries.  For all the war-dancing, defence-boosting and cheerleading in western capitals, Nato discipline has held. This is a conflict between Russia and its neighbour, its origins deep in east Europe’s histories and insecurities. Nothing could therefore be more dangerous than to agree with Putin’s narrative, to accept the revival of cold war antagonism between Russia and the west. Moral and logistical support for Kyiv is one thing, Nato planes in the air and boots on the ground are another. The latter would lead to a reckless and possibly uncontrollable escalation of the confrontation. 01:39Biden says remarks on Putin driven by 'moral outrage', not wish for regime change – video Cue America’s president, Joe Biden. Last week he arrived in Europe pumped up on belligerent rhetoric. In January he had suggested a Russian advance into Ukraine would constitute no more than “a minor incursion”. In March, he is telling American troops in Poland that they would soon see brave Ukrainians defying Russia “when you are there”. America would “respond in kind” to a chemical weapon attack on Ukraine, one that has not been threatened. Biden went further, calling Putin a “butcher”, one who “cannot remain in power”. He thus broke a longstanding protocol against the west demanding regime changes abroad (except when instigated by America). These remarks were similar to Biden’s “commitment” last October that America would “protect Taiwan” in the event of an invasion by Beijing, a flat rejection of Washington’s careful and longstanding ambiguity on the subject. What’s the plan, Joe? The west lacks a long-term strategy to defeat PutinRead more In all these cases, the White House and state department have instantly denied that Biden meant what he said. But the damage was done. Footage of him making the remarks is unnerving. What seemed at first a folksy ad-lib suggested a man not fully the master of his tongue, let alone his brief. Moscow broadcast Biden’s aggressive intent to the Russian people. France and Britain felt they had to reassert their non-engagement – inevitably dismaying the Ukrainians. Nato’s delicate unity had been undermined. Putin grasped eagerly at the reinforcement of his claim. The response to Biden’s speech of the veteran American diplomat, Richard Haass, was serious. “The fact that it was so off-script in some ways made it worse,” he said, as it indicated what his true beliefs are. It also suggests a split in the American administration’s view of the conflict, with the president already committed to a wider war. The prospect is thus of the world’s principal power blocs led by two men both with fingers on the nuclear button but with an apparently uncertain hold on reality. It is precisely the “madness” scenario foreseen by alarmist strategists of the 20th-century power struggle. The Ukraine war is clearly at a turning point; at the end of its beginning and possibly even at the beginning of its end. This is a moment of maximum uncertainty. Fighting on the ground is mostly stalemated. Ukraine’s allies have given almost as much logistical support as they dare, while avoiding risk of direct contact with the Russians. They know that the mere prospect of Nato troops on the battlefield would validate Putin’s narrative. It would risk unleashing an escalation in targets and weaponry. Ukraine would become a bloodbath, while Europe would confront a 1914-style triggering of alliance obligations. Zelenskiy has so far been masterful in mobilising his nation’s defence. He has shown what military analysts have never understood but has emerged from recent wars: that hi-tech weaponry and air superiority can be no match against simple fighters, even amateurs, with a cause in their hearts and a homeland at stake. Now, however, Zelenskiy must be no less masterful. He must negotiate the compromises that are inevitable if Ukraine’s cities are not to be utterly destroyed and Putin’s armed forces are to agree to withdraw. Remarks out of Kyiv in advance of this week’s peace talks in Istanbul seem aware of this realpolitik. In essence, Zelenskiy suggests a reversion to the 2015 Minsk 2 settlement. This acknowledged de facto Russia’s aversion – now reinforced – to any Nato advance to its border with Ukraine. It accepted the country’s virtual “Finlandisation”. But Minsk also agreed substantial but unrealised autonomy for the Donbas region, any refusal of which would seem to condemn the war to ongoing hell. The status of this autonomy will clearly be crucial. The old industrial districts of Donbas have been the source of anarchy within Ukraine in recent years. Such regional dissent has blighted the stability of half the nations of Europe over past decades – currently including Spain, France and the UK. Centralist regimes may decry them and treat separatism as an archaic curse. There is nothing unique about Ukraine, but today it proves the poison of centralism when left to fester. UK distances itself from Biden saying Putin ‘cannot remain in power’Read more Finding a constitutional path to autonomy for the Crimean and Donbas regions of Ukraine must hold the key to peace. Somewhere in the murky waters of devolved government, confederalism and “sovereignty-lite” lies a new future for this desperate corner of Europe. Much of Donbas has already been autonomous for eight years since 2014 and some recognition of this must surely be the price of peace. Fixing its border – and guaranteeing its acceptance – will be challenging. The last thing this diplomatic tightrope needs is to find itself a plaything of western domestic politics. Two Nato leaders, Biden and Britain’s Boris Johnson, are populists unschooled in the art of diplomacy. Both face electoral hostility at home. Both are prancing along Ukraine’s frontier beating their chests in parodies of Churchillian machismo. The bombast is not deterring Putin, but it strengthens his existential narrative and raises the war’s global profile. This must make him less inclined to accept the cost of any concession in defeat. Another maxim of war is to allow your enemy a bridge over which to retreat. That bridge is one of constitutional compromise in Donbas. It is an acceptance that this is Ukraine’s dispute with Putin, not the west’s with Russia. For the sake of a wider peace it must be kept that way.

The U.N. General Assembly resumed its 11th Emergency Special Session voting on a draft resolution condemning Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The resolution was passed with a vote of 141 for, 5 against, and 25 abstention.

There, 193 nations reviewed a resolution on Russia’s “aggression against Ukraine” and voted overwhelmingly to approve it: 141 votes in favor, 35 abstentions and just five votes against. Even some of Russia’s closest allies on the continent – Serbia, for example, or Hungary – voted to condemn the invasion. “The message of the general assembly is loud and clear,” said the UN secretary general, António Guterres. A no-fly zone means Nato shooting down Russian jets. We must not do that | Daniel L DavisRead more  What exactly is that message? In recent days, many commentators have pointed to a global map of the UN resolution to demonstrate the unity of the west and the world in taking on the Putin government. But to make sense of the geopolitical consequences of the Russian invasion, we must look beyond the diplomatic theater of the general assembly to examine how these nations are actually engaged with the war in this phase of rapid escalation. And to do that, we should start with a very different map of the world – a map of global participation in the sanctions set against Russia by the United States and its allies. The contrast between these maps could not be more striking. The US, the UK, Canada, South Korea, Switzerland, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, Taiwan, Singapore, the EU: beyond this fortified coalition, very few nations have chosen to take part in the economic warfare set against the Putin government. On the contrary, many of the world’s largest nations – including China, India, Brazil, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Indonesia and even Nato ally Turkey – have refused to join in. “We will not blindly follow the steps taken by another country,” said Indonesia’s foreign ministry representative at a recent press conference. Latin America has been equally steadfast in its commitment to neutrality. “We do not consider that [this war] concerns us,” said the Mexican president, Andrés Manuel López Obrador. “We are not going to take any sort of economic reprisal because we want to have good relations with all governments.” Argentina may have voted to condemn Russia’s actions at the UN, but its foreign minister, Santiago Cafiero, was adamant about his country’s non-participation in the new sanctions push: “Argentina does not consider that they are a mechanism to generate peace and harmony, or generate a frank dialogue table that serves to save lives.” The Latin American position has been echoed in Africa. “For five centuries, we have been pawns in the hands of the warring European states, bent on looting Africa of its human and natural sources,” says Pierre Sané, president of the Imagine Africa Institute and former secretary-general of Amnesty International. Sané tells me that the Ukrainian embassy in Senegal has been recruiting “volunteer” mercenaries from countries like Senegal and Ivory Coast to fight in the war. “Should this war in Ukraine escalate, we say and we say it loud: do not bring it to our shores.” Amid the Russian army’s brutal advance into Ukraine, a slew of letters, articles and Twitter commentary has addressed the “western left” for its apparent unwillingness to take on the Putin government. The invasion of Ukraine has been described as a “test” to root out the “pseudo-leftists” who fail to respond with force and conviction to support the west in its effort to isolate, undermine and eventually topple Putin in defense of the Ukrainian cause. But the map of sanctions suggests that the true rift is not between left and right, nor even between east and west. On the contrary, the map reveals a rift between north and south, between the nations that we call developed and those we call developing. And by revealing this tectonic shift, the map can tell us something important about geopolitics in the coming age of multipolarity. The rapid rise of China and the US reaction it has provoked have prompted many commentators to predict a coming cold war. Few expected Vladimir Putin to kick it off so suddenly. “Putin’s invasion of Ukraine has ended Americans’ 30-year holiday from history,” writes the former CIA director Robert Gates for the Washington Post. The immediate eviction of Russian representatives and Russian culture from the institutions of the west suggest the long slumber of the cold war may indeed be over: “Putin’s war has provided the cold shower needed to awaken democratic governments to the reality of a new world.” The good news for Gates is that the Biden administration has already found its cold war footing. Its flagship Summit for Democracy strives to unite “the nations of the free world” – a remarkable homage to the era of anti-Soviet mobilization – while isolating autocracies like Russia and China. That is, with the usual exceptions: Saudi Arabia’s oil, for example, grants the nation a free pass to the “free world”, as made evident by the recent delegation dispatched by the Biden administration to secure the kingdom’s support to keep the oil flowing through the war effort in Ukraine. In the age of unipolarity – in the long 30-year holiday that followed the collapse of the Soviet Union – the nations of the world were given a rather simple choice: side with the United States, or stand alone. Some nations sought to band together in collective acts of resistance to this hegemonic power. But the consequences were all but inevitable: invasions, coups and extensive sanctions to isolate their economies from the world at large. As new powers generate new poles, however, the options available to US neighbor nations are no longer restricted to compliance and resistance. A third option emerges: neutrality. “Neutrality does not mean indifference,” says Pierre Sané. “Neutrality means continuously calling for the respect of international laws; neutrality means that our hearts still go to the victims of military invasions and arbitrary sanctions never imposed on Nato countries.” Back in the first cold war, neutrality had a name: non-alignment. As the United States clashed with China and the Soviet Union in the skies above Korea, Jawaharlal Nehru and Josip Broz Tito refused to take a side. “The people of Yugoslavia cannot accept the postulate that humanity today has only one choice – a choice between a domination of one or the other bloc,” Yugoslavia’s minister of foreign affairs, Edvard Kardelj, told the UN in 1950. “We believe that there exists another road.” The Non-Aligned Movement was born five years later, uniting more than 100 nations around the world around principles of non-interference and peaceful coexistence. Today, nations around the world are called again to take sides – between Russia and the west, and very soon between the west and China. But as the map of sanctions attests, the cross-pressure between these great powers may once again spark a movement for non-alignment, demanding a more universal application of international law against demands for unilateral exception. There will no doubt be consequences for this neutral position. Non-aligned nations in the first cold war were frequently victim to aggression, invasion and economic embargo. The same risks to neutrality are visible today. Lithuania recently canceled a shipment of Covid vaccines to Bangladesh for its refusal to condemn Russia at the United Nations. The US, for its part, has already passed the Countering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (Caatsa), giving license to punish countries with sanctions for trading with the other side. But as great powers prepare for a new century of war, the call for non-alignment will only grow louder. Our task is to understand that call now as Tito and Nehru understood it then: not as “neutralism” or “passivity, as is sometimes alleged”. As they wrote in a joint declaration in 1954: “It represents the positive, active and constructive policy that, as its goal, has collective peace as the foundation of collective security.” This article was amended on 28 March 2022 to clarify that the embassy Pierre Sané referred to as recruiting “volunteer” mercenaries from countries like Senegal and Ivory Coast, was the Ukrainian embassy in Senegal.

US president Joe Biden has denied he is calling for regime change in Russia, after he said during a visit to Poland that Putin “cannot remain in power”. When asked by a reporter if he wanted to see Russian president Vladimir Putin removed from office he said “no”. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, had already distanced himself from Biden’s comments, while the UK cabinet minister Nadhim Zahawi distanced the UK government from his remarks.
Representatives from Russia and Ukraine will meet this week for a new round of talks aimed at ending the war. Ukraine said the two sides would meet in Turkey on Monday.
Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy used a video interview with independent Russian media outlets to signal his willingness to discuss having Ukraine adopt a “neutral status”, and also make compromises about the status of the eastern Donbas region, in order to secure a peace agreement with Russia. But he said he was not willing to discuss Ukrainian demilitarisation, and that Ukrainians would need to vote in a referendum to approve their country adopting a neutral status.
In a separate late-night video, Zelenskiy promised to work this week for new sanctions against Russia and spoke of the impending new round negotiations, saying “we are looking for peace without delay.”
 Zelenskiy also claimed that 2,000 children from Mariupol have been taken by Russia, according to a press release published by the president’s office late on Sunday. “According to our data, more than 2,000 children were deported. Which means they were abducted. Because we do not know the exact locations of all these children. There were children with and without parents. It’s a catastrophe, it’s horrible.” Zelenskiy said the city remained blocked by the Russian military, describing the situation as a humanitarian catastrophe. “Food, medicine, and water can’t be delivered. The Russian troops are shelling humanitarian convoys and killing drivers.”
Ukraine’s deputy prime minister has accused Russia of “irresponsible” acts around the occupied Chernobyl power station that could send radiation across much of Europe, and urged the United Nations to dispatch a mission to assess the risks in an update to her Telegram account.
The UK Ministry of Defence said Russia is “effectively isolating Ukraine from international maritime trade”, in an update late Sunday. It also said Russian naval forces were continuing to conduct sporadic missile strikes against targets across Ukraine.
The Ukrainian military claimed Russia has withdrawn troops that were surrounding Kyiv after suffering significant losses in its latest operational report.
Russia’s communications and internet regulator said in a public statement it would investigate the outlets that interviewed Zelenskiy, and has told them not to distribute the interview.
Putin is seeking to split Ukraine into two, emulating the postwar division between North and South Korea, Ukraine’s military intelligence chief has said. In comments that raise the prospect of a long and bitter frozen conflict, General Kyrylo Budanov, warned of bloody guerrilla warfare.
The French foreign minister said on Sunday there would be “collective guilt” if nothing was done to help civilians in Mariupol, the Ukrainian city besieged by Russian forces.
The UK government’s top legal adviser has appointed a war crimes lawyer to advise Ukraine on the Russian invasion. The attorney general, Suella Braverman, announced on Sunday that Sir Howard Morrison QC would act as an independent adviser to the Ukrainian prosecutor general, Iryna Venediktova, Press Association reported.
Germany is considering purchasing a missile defence system to shield against a potential attack from Russia, Chancellor Olaf Scholz said late on Sunday.
Despite reports that Zelenskiy had been pushing to speak on video during the Academy Awards ceremony in Los Angeles tonight, attendees instead observed a 30-second silence as tribute to the people of Ukraine. 28 Mar 202204.25The risks are stacking up for Asia’s once-promising economic recovery from the pandemic, thanks to the war in Ukraine, US policy rate rises, spiking energy prices, and escalating Covid cases in China.Analysts at S&P Global Ratings said on Monday that these new risks will lead to inflation across Asia Pacific, and that they will dent an otherwise strong rebound from the pandemic.“We have generally lowered our growth forecasts across Asia-Pacific and raised our inflation expectations. This reflects already-higher energy and commodity prices, an expectation of Fed interest rate increases, and the volatility and inflation effects of the Russia-Ukraine war,” they said.Stock markets in Asia were down on Monday with the Nikkei losing 0.4%. 28 Mar 202204.23The weekend once again saw dozens of protests against Russia’s invasion of Ukraine continue in cities across the world.Supporters carry placards as they attend a protest against war and for peace in Ukraine, at Piazza della Repubblica, in Rome, Italy on Sunday.

Another man, an electrician, says that Russia could have legitimate claim to Ukraine: “I hear that Ukraine used to be a part of Russia, but instead of respecting that, Nato is pulling Ukraine into its own orbit.

Sean Penn has openly campaigned for Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy — a former actor — to speak at the ceremony. Some arrived for the Oscars wearing blue-and-gold ribbons, an obvious show of support since those are the colours of the Ukrainian flag.When McIntyre’s song ended, a large video screen hovering over the stage displayed a tribute and a plea as the 30-second moment of silence began.“We’d like to have a moment of silence to show our support for the people of Ukraine currently facing invasion, conflict and prejudice within their own borders,” read the screen. “While film is an important avenue for us to express our humanity in times of conflict, the reality is millions of families in Ukraine need food, medical care, clean water and emergency services. Resources are scarce and we — collectively as a global community — can do more.”It then ended with a display of the following: “We ask you to support Ukraine in any way you are able. #StandWithUkraine.”Gregg Donovan holds up an Oscar statue with a sign reading ‘Glory To Ukraine’ ahead of the Oscars Award show at the Dolby Theatre on Hollywood Boulevard in Los Angeles, California.

It’s not just a war, I think it’s much worse.”Zelenskiy noted that before the war some Ukrainians were loyal to Russia but after the destruction of their cities and death of civilians, this attitude has changed to hatred, adding that he believed the damage is “irreparable”.I think this is the worst disappointment that has happened. Disappointment that turned into hatred of the nations. I have no answer as to how it can be returned, there is no answer as to whether it will ever return.” 28 Mar 202202.41Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy has provided some more detail surrounding his earlier claim that 2,000 children from Mariupol have been taken by Russia.Zelenskiy confirmed that people were leaving the city through humanitarian corridors using civilian transport, but Russia also “organised the forcible removal of Mariupol residents to the occupied territories,” according to a press release published by the president’s office late on Sunday.According to our data, more than 2,000 children were deported. Which means they were abducted. Because we do not know the exact locations of all these children. There were children with and without parents. It’s a catastrophe, it’s horrible.”Zelenskiy continued: The reality is that the city is blocked by the Russian military, all entrances and exits from Mariupol are blocked, the port is mined. The humanitarian catastrophe in the city is obvious. Because food, medicine, and water can’t be delivered. The Russian troops are shelling humanitarian convoys and killing drivers.” Due to the shelling, many humanitarian convoys returned without reaching Mariupol, Zelenskiy added.The president said that there was an attempt to agree with the Russian side on the removal of the bodies of killed soldiers and civilians lying in the open air, but such removal was not allowed. 28 Mar 202202.13Russia withdraws troops surrounding Kyiv after 'signifiant losses': Ukraine militaryThe Ukrainian military has released its latest operational report as of 10pm local time, claiming Russia has withdrawn troops that were surrounding Kyiv after suffering significant losses. The withdrawal has “significantly decreased” the intensity of Russia’s advance and forced some units to regroup in Belarus, the general staff of the armed forces said.Officials added that they believed Russia was also transporting ‘Iskander’ missiles to Kalinkovichy in the Gomel region of south-eastern Belarus.Ukrainian service members stand next to parts of military equipment in the town of Trostianets in Sumy region, Ukraine.

Maybe it wasn’t envisaged as a siege war but today we’re in siege warfare, and Mariupol is one of the most striking examples.“Military sieges are horrible wars because civil populations are massacred, annihilated. The suffering is terrible.” 28 Mar 202201.21Germany is considering purchasing a missile defence system to shield against a potential attack from Russia, Chancellor Olaf Scholz said late on Sunday.When asked during an appearance on public broadcaster ARD whether Germany might buy a defence system such as Israel’s Iron Dome, Scholz said:“This is certainly one of the issues we are discussing, and for good reason,” though he did not specify what type of system Berlin was considering.When asked whether Germany aimed to procure a missile defence system with a longer range than its existing Patriot batteries, Scholz said: “We need to be aware that we have a neighbour who is prepared to use violence to enforce their interests.”The Bild am Sonntag newspaper reported earlier a missile defence shield for the whole territory of Germany was one of the topics discussed when Scholz met with Eberhard Zorn, Germany’s chief of defence.Specifically, they spoke about a possible acquisition of the Israeli “Arrow 3” system, the paper said.Andreas Schwarz, a member of parliament for Scholz’ Social Democrats, told the newspaper: We must protect ourselves better against the threat from Russia. For this, we need a Germany-wide missile defence shield quickly. The Israeli Arrow 3 system is a good solution.” 27 Mar 202200.53French president Emmanuel Macron earlier called for restraint in both words and actions in dealing with the Ukraine conflict, after US president Joe Biden described Russian president Vladimir Putin as a “butcher” and said he should not remain in power. “I wouldn’t use this type of wording because I continue to hold discussions with president Putin,” Macron told France 3. “What do we want to do collectively?

Such damage will inevitably lead to the entry into the atmosphere of a significant amount of radioactive dust and contaminate not only Ukraine but also other European countries.”Vereshchuk continued to claim that the occupying Russian forces “ ignored these threats, continuing to transport and store a significant amount of ammunition in the immediate vicinity of the nuclear power plant” and through the city of Pripyat.Russian occupiers transport tens of tons of rockets, shells and mortar ammunition every day. Hundreds of tons of ammunition are being stored in the neighbouring city of Pripyat Chernobyl, which is also a short distance from the nuclear power plant.”Vereshchuk noted the dangers of Russia’s use of “old and substandard ammunition” which “increases the risk of their detonation even during loading and transportation.”Ukraine’s deputy prime minister has accused Russia of “irresponsible” acts around the occupied Chernobyl power station that could send radiation across much of Europe Photograph: Gleb Garanich/ReutersIn addition, she said significant fires have started in the exclusion zone, which can have “very serious consequences.”“It is impossible to control and extinguish fires in full due to the capture of the exclusion zone by the Russian occupation forces,” she said.As a result of combustion, radionuclides are released into the atmosphere, which the wind can carry over long distances, which threatens radiation not only in Ukraine but also in other European countries. Loss of control over the exclusion zone and the inability to fully extinguish the fire could threaten radiation facilities in the area.”In the context of nuclear security, the irresponsible and unprofessional actions of the Russian military pose a very serious threat not only to Ukraine but also to hundreds of millions of Europeans.”Vereshchuk urged the UN Security Council to “take immediate measures to demilitarise the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone and establish a special UN mission” to eliminate the risk of a recurrence of the Chernobyl accident.Updated at 01.09 BST 27 Mar 202200.29The UK’s ministry of defence has just released its latest intelligence report on the situation in Ukraine, claiming Russia is “effectively isolating Ukraine from international maritime trade.”Russia is maintaining a distant blockade of Ukraine’s Black Sea coast, effectively isolating Ukraine from international maritime trade.
Russian naval forces are also continuing to conduct sporadic missile strikes against targets throughout Ukraine.

But those moves would require amending the constitution or a referendum, neither of which can be done in wartime, analysts say. What is neutrality?  Under international law, a country is neutral if it won’t interfere in situations of international armed conflict involving other belligerent parties. It cannot allow a belligerent party to use its territory as a base of military operations, take sides or supply military equipment. What has Zelenskiy said? President Volodymyr Zelenskiy acknowledged on 15 March that Ukraine was not able to join Nato. “We’ve heard for years that the door is open, but we also heard that we can’t join. That’s the truth we much recognise,” Zelenskiy said in remarks seen as abandoning Ukraine’s Nato aspirations and considered by some Ukrainians as an unacceptable concession. ‘The world is waiting for good news’: Russia-Ukraine peace talks press on in Turkey Read more At peace talks in Turkey on Tuesday, Ukrainian negotiators said Kyiv was ready to accept neutrality if, under an international accord, western states like the United States, France and Britain provided binding security guarantees. However, Ukraine’s aspiration to join Nato is written in the country’s constitution, which cannot be amended during martial law, as is in effect now, or during a state of emergency. Could Ukraine change its constitution? Any change would require approval of the measure by 300 out of 450 lawmakers in two separate parliamentary sessions, and then be validated by the constitutional court. “There aren’t the 300 votes today, but if the conflict continues and we see that Nato isn’t helping, opinions could change,” said Ukrainian political scientist, Volodymyr Fesenko. “Zelenskiy’s disappointment with insufficient Nato aid is shifting public opinion. For us, Nato is the simplest and least painful concession,” he added. What do Ukrainians want? According to the latest survey conducted by the Rating polling firm earlier this month, 44% of Ukrainians feel that their country should join Nato, a drop of two percentage points from the poll done in February before the Russian invasion began. Some 42% believe Ukraine should continue to cooperate with Nato but not join. Putin may ramp up his war in Ukraine – here’s how Nato should respond | Ivo DaalderRead more “The Ukrainians want to join Nato, but if Europe offers EU membership and proposes a financial package to rebuild Ukraine, the Nato debate could be forgotten for a while,” said Mykola Davydiuk, a Kyiv-based political analyst. “If Britain, France and the United States – three nuclear powers – provide security guarantees, such an alliance would be stronger than integration into Nato,” he added. Ukrainian negotiators in Turkey on Tuesday compared the security guarantees they want to the Nato treaty’s Article 5 where members agree to come to the defence of one another in case of military aggression.

Ben Wallace, who convened the event, said there would be “more lethal aid going into Ukraine” but that it would not include tanks or some of the other more deadly weapons that Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, had asked for in the past week.  He said Ukraine needed longer-range artillery to counter Russian attacks on the its cities, including Mariupol in the south, which has been subjected to relentless shelling. “The best counter to that is other long-range artillery, so they’ll be looking for and getting more long-range artillery, ammunition predominantly,” he said in an interview after the conference concluded. Ukraine was also “looking for armoured vehicles of some types, not tanks necessarily, but certainly protective vehicles, and more anti-air,” Wallace said. “All of this will be forthcoming as result of this conference.” The commitments to provide artillery pieces, shells and armoured vehicles represent a step up from the weaponry previously supplied, which has been characterised by Nato members as defensive. Nato countries led by the US, UK and Turkey had previously agreed to supply Javelin surface-to-air missiles, next generation light anti-tank weapons (NLAWs), Stinger anti-aircraft missiles and TB2 drones, all of which have helped blunt the Russian invasion over the past five weeks. Zelenskiy has repeatedly asked western nations in the last fortnight for tanks, fighter jets and sophisticated anti-missile and anti-aircraft weaponry so his country’s forces can try to force Russia’s troops out of the country. He pleaded for “military assistance without restrictions” at Nato’s summit last week, asking specifically for “1% of all your planes, 1% of your tanks” because Russia was using “its entire arsenal against us”. Western leaders, however, have been nervous about supplying offensive weapons, most notably fighter jets, fearing that it would unnecessarily provoke a nuclear-armed Russia and could invite some form of retaliation from Moscow. More than 35 countries participated in the donor conference, including European nations, Japan, South Korea and New Zealand, but their individual commitments were not immediately clear. Some countries intend to supply Ukraine with their own stocks, while others have offered Kyiv money to buy its own arms. Those present discussed “whether we need to change the type of aid we give, which of course we will do now as the tactics in the ground change”, Wallace said. Russia abandoned its attempt to capture Kyiv this week after an unexpectedly chaotic assault on the country. Instead it has refocussed its efforts on capturing the southern port city of Mariupol and gaining ground against Ukraine’s main fighting force in the eastern Donbas region. Ukraine’s most obvious military problem is its inability to counter the ceaseless Russian shelling that has caused so many civilian casualties in Mariupol. Ukraine estimates that 5,000 people have been killed in the city, but the figure cannot be verified because of the ongoing fighting. The countries present also agreed to supply coastal defence systems, the UK Ministry of Defence said, which could help defend the southern city of Odessa and disrupt Russian warships in the Black Sea from launching cruise missiles. Several western countries have been running down their own stocks to supply Ukraine, but David Williams, the permanent secretary of the MoD, said British arms manufacturers supplying NLAWs and other kit being used in the war had been asked to increase production to replenish what had been used.",,,,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6f96e998cbb89c84f3e1abea7cfaa34885a57ab9/0_233_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=3b10a8ea2e068f7d02528365837206dc

Emmanuel Macron continues his dogged round of phone calls with Vladimir Putin, but it is the Turkish foreign ministry that seems able to bring the Ukrainians and Russians together.  It is a curious position. Turkey, a Nato member, continues to supply weapons to Ukraine, while refusing to impose sanctions on Russia, and yet is apparently respected enough by both sides to host Tuesday’s talks. The Turks also have a profound sense of what may be at stake. Speaking at the weekend in Doha, Ibrahim Kalin, the adviser and spokesperson to the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, spelled it out: “Once this is all over, there will have to be a new security architecture to emerge globally. How that global security architecture will be structured will shape the course of events for decades to come. Every step we take, every move we make to bring an end to this war will have an impact on that new security architecture.” In short, this is a set of peace talks that could have reverberations not just for the combatants, but the world. The world leaders pushing for peace in Ukraine, and their motivesRead more It would also be wrong to think Turkey does not have its own point of view. Kalin says: “What led to this war needs to be studied carefully. The power disequilibrium that has shaped the international order ever since the end of the cold war over the last three decades has everything to do with the rise of this crisis and eventually the war we are trying to stop now.” Although he said the war was unjustified and unprovoked, he added: “Whatever causes and grievances or security concerns Russia had going to this war have to be heard, not justified. We need to talk to Russia. If everybody burns bridges with Russia who is going to talk to them at the end of the day?” By inference, he was saying the era of American hegemony had to end. The foreign minister, Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu, on Saturday said he believed Ukraine’s best interests lay in pursuing a balanced foreign policy. Turkey may even provide a role model of sorts, he suggested, refusing to choose between east and west – something he said Turkey had been forced to do due to its geography. The reality is more complex, and probably more self-serving. After a long period offending many in the region, Turkey – perhaps driven by economic weakness – has been mending fences. The Ukrainian delegation leaves after the peace talks with Russia in Istanbul on Tuesday. Photograph: Emrah Yorulmaz/Anadolu/Getty Either way, Çavuşoğlu said, “We have to find a face-saving way out or an honourable exit for both sides that they can sell publicly and globally.” The initial Turkey-hosted meeting, between Ukrainian foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba and Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov, took place earlier this month, on the fringes of the Antalya Diplomacy Forum. It made little progress, even if Kuleba fleshed out the offer for Ukraine to drop its request to join Nato and instead adopt a neutral status in return for security guarantees provided by an unidentified group of countries. Lavrov was clearly not briefed to make serious response. But at the talks on Tuesday in Istanbul, initially slated to last two days, the Ukrainian offer became more explicit, and was delivered in writing. The Ukrainian delegation this time was headed up by the adviser to the president of Ukraine, Mihaylo Podolyak, and the Russian delegation was led by presidential aide Vladimir Medinsky. Kalin had been instrumental in assembling the cast list. The presence of Roman Abramovich at the talks shows how central the former Chelsea football club owner has become. Why is Abramovich playing peacemaker after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine?Read more Podolyak said Ukraine wanted to see China, Russia, the US, France, Turkey, Germany, Canada and Israel as the guarantor states. Their role, akin to the Nato article 5 commitment, would be to protect Ukraine’s sovereignty if threatened. It is a reworking of the Budapest memorandum of 1994. Podolyak claimed “preliminary acceptance came from some countries that we wanted to be guarantor countries”, adding he thought ground existed for a meeting hosted by Turkey, a goal alongside a humanitarian ceasefire the Turkish foreign minister said was achievable. “Nothing very promising so far” was the downbeat account from Moscow on Wednesday. But Turkey is more optimistic and thinks there is a plan capable of gaining traction. Turkey’s next aim is to get Volodymyr Zelenskiy  and Putin in the same room in the next fortnight. At the moment it seems unlikely Putin thinks he is losing, or has much to gain from such an encounter. But if Turkey pulls it off, it would be an extraordinary turnaround for Erdoğan, whose autocratic tendencies had threatened to make him an international pariah.",,,,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eccc3b5571a27576cf362cfa452ff34bd3a1a281/0_269_2048_1229/master/2048.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=c6f53da0f55cf940962e25d7757ec0bd

They suggest uniformity but it is often said of the British army that if two officers look the same, one must be improperly dressed. Armies, and especially professional armies, are more often warring tribes of subcultures, and for commanders it is critical to understand how those cultures interact if the force is to be employed effectively in battle. When it comes to Russian military culture, the Russian army has been through a period of significant change, with constant modernisation since 2008. The Soviet Union fielded an army of more than 3.5 million soldiers in 1991. The Soviet army was largely a conscript force and lacked an experienced noncommissioned officer corps. This meant that Soviet units had to be treated with a degree of uniformity, since the personnel rotated so frequently that most line units were necessarily commanded using set formulas that formed the basis for unit training.  Conscript David Arutyunyan, 18, the youngest Russian soldier known to have died in Ukraine. Photograph: Social Media/east2west news Today’s Russian military is much smaller with about 1 million personnel across all services. For the army, conscripts today make up only about 35% of the force. The high proportion of contract soldiers should produce a more distinct unit culture. This is reinforced by how units have been fighting. Among Russia’s higher-readiness forces, the wars in Ukraine and Syria have seen fighting being conducted primarily at the level of the company group, producing units with contract troops who have fought together, but rarely in large formations. This process of experience being concentrated into small units of action has been further accelerated by the expansion of Russian special purpose units. FSB (security service) units have for a long time been focused on repressive counter-terrorism alongside Chechen troops, who are well equipped but largely lack experience of heavy fighting. GU and KSO “special purpose troops”, meanwhile, have tended to operate in small teams – sometimes down to pairs – behind enemy lines. Although the Russian officer corps has been rotated through Donbas and Syria, the scale of activity they managed there has been limited. As well as disparities in experience between Russian military units, there is also the different geographic focus of various formations. Russia spans 11 time zones, and consequently its military districts are confronted with very different problems. The Western Military District was positioned to confront Nato. The Southern Military District was set up for expeditionary operations. The Northern Military District is responsible for the high north, and the Eastern Military District guards Vladivostok and the Chinese border. Because formations in these regions are aligned to a variety of threats, they receive different equipment, with the eastern district usually the last to get upgraded vehicles and gear. The challenge that Russia has struggled to address is that while its force has become increasingly fragmented into units where experience is largely confined to company-sized or at most battalion-sized actions, Russia’s political aspirations have far exceeded the capacity of these formations. Battalion tactical groups operating under independent brigades, for example, proved logistically inadequate in 2015, leading to the reintroduction of divisions to manage supply. Pro-Russian servicemen on parade in Donetsk in June 2020.  Photograph: Dave Mustaine/EPA Preparing for the war in Ukraine, Russia has drawn troops from across its military districts, fielding 190,000 personnel from units that have rarely worked together and that use a wide range of equipment of varying vintage. Further complexity emerges from the mobilisation of raw recruits from the occupied Luhansk and Donetsk enclaves, the deployment of interior riot police and Rosgvardia (national guard) troops, meant for crowd control rather than warfighting, and Wagner mercenaries. Some Rosgvardia personnel have refused to deploy to Ukraine. Wagner include some experienced soldiers, though their track record in offensive operations is poor. They have also not previously participated in large-scale Russian military exercises, making it ambiguous how they are to be commanded in the field. Dictators like Putin surround themselves with liars and propaganda. That leads to very bad decisions | Robert ReichRead more Planning to deploy such a diverse force would usually require careful consideration as to how units with different equipment, experience, culture and training levels would interact and complement one another. The sequencing of which units would attack first would be carefully worked out. Instead, these units have largely been committed piecemeal, using the same roads, with limited efforts to establish effective control measures or assign battlespace. Although units were given markings to indicate their axis of advance, many formations have become intermingled, causing friendly fire incidents and confusion, and cratering morale. Slowly, Russian senior officers have begun to impose order on operations, but with too many troops pushed forward, too few reserves and insufficient logistical support, they are paying a heavy price for early blunders. In many respects, the Russian military has been caught between its political aspirations to fight large wars, and the experience of its soldiers, which has been confined to small ones.

He repeated warnings that Russia was preparing for strikes in the Donbas region and Kharkiv. In a video address late on Friday, he said Russian troops in the north of the country were slowly pulling back.
Zelenskiy also said that Russia was trying to conscript troops from Crimea, but said that being drafted to fight in Ukraine was “guaranteed death for many young guys”. He warned their families: “We don’t need more dead people here. Save your children so they do not become villains. Don’t send them.”
Ukraine exchanged 86 members of their armed forces with Russia today, according to senior Ukrainian officials.
Russia says Ukrainian helicopters attacked an oil storage facility in Belgorod, Russia, about 16 miles from the border and close to Kharkiv, destroying fuel tanks. Ukrainian officials have denied their forces were involved.
The UK Ministry of Defence says the destruction of oil tanks at a depot in the Russian city of Belgorod means probable loss of fuel and ammunition supplies to invading forces. It will likely add more strain to Russia’s already stretched logistic chains. Supplies to Russian forces encircling Kharkhiv may be particularly affected.
The US department of defense will provide an additional $300 million in security assistance to Ukraine, to include laser-guided rocket systems, drones, and commercial satellite imagery services.
The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, earlier spoke with Ukraine’s foreign minister Dmytro Kulebo today and discussed “ways the US allies and partners are helping Ukraine defend against Putin’s unprovoked and unjustified war”, Blinken said.
The US State Department said Washington will continue to provide support to Ukraine and won’t push the country to make concessions in negotiations with Russia following a report that said Britain was concerned the US, France and Germany will push Ukraine to “settle” in a peace deal.
The US military has cancelled plans to test an intercontinental ballistic missile in an effort to reduce tensions with Russia.
Zelenskiy also said more than 3,000 people had been led to safety from the besieged city of Mariupol. More than 6,000 in total had been rescued from Mariupol, Donetsk, Luhansk, and Zaporizhzhia. The International Committee of the Red Cross said it had been unable to reach the city but will try again to evacuate civilians on Saturday.

The war’s economic impact, already manifesting itself through spiralling inflation and living costs, could have seriously negative political consequences for elected leaders in the US, Germany, France and the UK. If public willingness to make difficult sacrifices diminishes in the months ahead and the conflict slips off the front pages, will they stay the course? As Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, is keenly aware, western love for his country is already highly conditional. Military assistance is limited by Nato’s fear of provoking Vladimir Putin. Emmanuel Macron, France’s president, is “over-eagerly” pushing for a negotiated deal at the risk, British officials claim, of overriding Kyiv’s best interests. Accused by his far-right rival, Marine Le Pen, of ignoring domestic problems, Macron’s poll lead has narrowed before this month’s two-round election.  Germany’s chancellor, Olaf Scholz, is currently fixated on the security of domestic energy supplies, not the future security of Europe. He knows Putin’s threat to cut off the gas, if implemented, would spark a national emergency. Scholz’s ruling coalition is creaking after a row with the Greens, who say he and his former boss, Angela Merkel, were “blind” to the risks of energy dependence on Russia. This argument will only intensify, the longer the war continues – and not only in Germany. “Europe should stop spending up to €800m per day on purchasing Russian gas,” a new paper from the Centre for European Reform argues. “In 2021 … Russia exported more than 49% of its oil and 74% of its gas to Europe.” Halting all such purchases voluntarily, it said, might be the most effective sanction Europe could impose. “The political will to take such a radical step is still absent.” And, sadly, likely to remain so. Joe Biden’s Nato and EU summitry last weekend did not produce a much-needed long-term plan for defeating Russia or better weapons for Ukraine’s defenders. But it did raise questions about his leadership. Biden’s crisis management has brought a modest poll boost. A new survey showed 61% of Americans believe higher petrol prices, up 20% in a month, are worth it to beat Russia. Most support additional US troop deployments. This spirit of solidarity is finite. Biden looks tired and vulnerable, with a low overall approval rating But this spirit of solidarity is finite. Biden looks tired and vulnerable, with a low overall approval rating of 41%. Only 39% approve his handling of the economy. This is the battlefield that matters most in the US as a neo-Trumpist Republican party eyes a takeover of Congress in November. This is why the White House has tapped its strategic oil reserves. Will stumbling Biden stay the course, or seek a quick way out? In the US and EU, early anti-Putin momentum seems to have stalled and may even be reversing. Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, urged Brussels last week to swiftly introduce a fifth sanctions package. But foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said the EU would “maintain” rather than “elevate” pressure on Moscow – the overly cautious approach favoured by Paris and Berlin which infuriates Poland and the Baltic republics. Russia is actively exploiting these divisions. “The irresponsible Brussels sanctions already negatively affect the daily life of ordinary Europeans,” a foreign ministry official said. Western leaders risked making their peoples’ situation worse, the official added, amid fresh Russian threats to block food and agricultural exports. Meanwhile, China and India give succour to Putin by buying discounted Russian oil. Ukraine-related pressures on western leaders are undoubtedly escalating across the board. The IMF warned last month that the war would cause “devastating” damage to the global economy as well as deep recessions in Russia and Ukraine. One forecast published last month predicted a £90bn hit to the UK alone as consumers and businesses struggle to recover from the pandemic. In Spain, the far-right populist party, Vox, has used rising prices to fuel anti-government demonstrations. Similarly politicised protests have been seen in France, Italy and Greece. Worries about a wider war, meanwhile, may help Viktor Orbán, Hungary’s Putin-friendly prime minister, win re-election this weekend. It may be that western politicians will keep their word and honour their commitments to Ukraine. Or maybe not. Zelenskiy, for one, has his doubts. Speaking to the Economist, he expressed reservations about the trustworthiness and reliability of some leaders, including Boris Johnson. “Britain wants Ukraine to win and Russia to lose … It is not performing a balancing act,” Zelenskiy said. But he added that he was unsure whether Johnson secretly hoped the war would drag on, thereby weakening Putin (and strengthening Johnson). Zelenskiy said Germany’s “pragmatic” Scholz was mistakenly “on the fence” and urged Orbán to pick a side. His harshest words were reserved for Macron’s government. “They are afraid,” he said bluntly. If the war grinds on into the autumn, as many predict, economic pain, especially over energy costs, resulting political stresses, “sanctions fatigue”, increased public apathy, and the daunting financial cost of open-ended military assistance, humanitarian aid, and millions of refugees could combine to critically undermine governments’ support for Ukraine’s fight. A western failure on this scale would be a disaster for Ukraine’s people, Europe’s security and common decency. But it’s possible to see how it might happen. Putin, of course, is watching, waiting for fatal cracks to appear. Yet he, too, faces deeply threatening internal tensions and challenges, as western intelligence chiefs noted last week. They suggest he’s at odds with his generals, is out of touch, and could be losing control. Maybe this is how the war ends. Not with a bang or a shabby deal but with a slow collapse. Who will last longer: Putin the deluded, paranoid war criminal, or the motley crew of unreliable western politicians who oppose him?",/p/y6mz8,295,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/apr/03/will-western-leaders-cut-and-run-as-the-costs-of-the-ukraine-war-mount#comments,

In doing so, western nations are quietly crossing the defensive-only threshold set by leaders at the start of the crisis. But the question remains whether the gradual escalation in arms deliveries can avoid a Russian retaliation and turn the tide on the battlefield, where Moscow is seeking to wage a more conventional military-on-military war in the eastern Donbas.  “The issue will be how much the west shifts to offensive weaponry,” said Phil Osborn, a former UK chief of defence intelligence, “and the absolute criticality of ensuring that the supply of critical military kit is maintained and increased.” Russia-Ukraine war: Russia’s retreat from Kyiv ‘largely complete’, say western officials; people in east told to flee – liveRead more Ukraine’s military spent the first six weeks of the war trying to pick off invading Russian armoured columns with light infantry using anti-tank bazookas. Poor Russian tactics and Ukrainian determination successfully forced the overstretched attackers to abandon their attacks on Kyiv, and Chernihiv and Sumy in the north-east. But Ukraine now has to deal with Russian forces in the east and south that have made more defensible gains and are better dug in. In the past 24 hours it has emerged that the Czech Republic has sent a dozen Soviet designed T-72 tanks, plus howitzer artillery pieces and BMP-1 armoured vehicles, a significant shift in the direction of supplying “offensive weapons” that western politicians had insisted they were not prepared to do. That by itself is not enough to make more than a dent in the 94 tanks that Ukraine is estimated by researchers at Oryx to have lost in the fighting so far – but there is persistent speculation Poland could spare 100 more, now it has reached a separate agreement on Tuesday to buy 250 US Abrams tanks for $4.75bn. The UK is considering sending non-lethal armoured vehicles to Ukraine for patrol and reconnaissance work, according to a report in the Times. The next phase of the war – which could yet be decisive – is expected to unfold in the Donbas in the next month as Russian forces seek to capture Mariupol, create a land bridge to Crimea, expand the area of occupation in the self-proclaimed republics in Donetsk and Luhansk – and perhaps encircle Ukraine’s main fighting force ranged against it. It is a struggle that will unfold over the course of April. Western intelligence officials believe the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, will want an “announceable success” for the country’s traditional Victory Day parade on 9 May, placing considerable emphasis on what the west is prepared to supply now. A handful or two of Czech tanks, or the four Bushmaster armoured vehicles sent by Australia, will not make much difference. “If we had already got what we needed – all these planes, tanks, artillery, anti-missile and anti-ship weapons – we could have saved thousands of people,” Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said earlier this week. The US announced it would send a further $100m of Javelin anti-tank missiles on Wednesday, on top of $300m of equipment on Friday, which includes two new sets of weapons, designed to help Ukrainian forces better attack the Russians. Friday’s batch included “laser-guided rocket systems” thought by experts to refer to APKWS rockets. These are traditionally mounted on planes – and possibly drones – but can be used on the ground, and could in that instance help counter Russia’s preponderance in heavy artillery, which has caused so many Ukrainian casualties. A second element of Friday’s package was 10 Switchblade 600 combat drones, which have a range of 90km and can fly for 40 minutes, and carry the same anti-tank warhead as the Javelin anti-tank weapon – a replacement for lost Turkish TB2 drones, giving Ukraine more options on the battlefield. Nick Reynolds, a land warfare expert at Rusi, said he believed the Switchblade drones were “an urgent requirement” because they could help “strike Russian command nodes, electronic warfare vehicles, logistics hubs, artillery and air defence systems in depth” – reaching deep behind the frontline in Donbas. The growing supply will certainly help Ukraine fight the second phase of the Russian attack, but it is probably not until the end of April that a clearer picture will emerge of the revised military balance. Without more tanks, in particular, it is not obvious that Ukraine can relieve the besieged Mariupol. Meanwhile, the west’s aims are becoming less clear. Is the goal to allow Ukraine to force the Kremlin into peace talks – or try to inflict a more heavy defeat that would risk provoking an unpredictable Russian president? A western official cautioned on Wednesday that it would be “fundamentally different” to try to force Russian forces out of the separatist republics of Donetsk and Luhansk and Crimea because of “the way in which Russia would defend those interests”.",,,,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ac24c3b6400eaf1be9aed7a31f6cba7437a49c96/0_0_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=d1aa53275d3c7acd96db204bcb706f90

A further 100 Russian diplomats had been expelled in the preceding two months.  EU allies expel 200 Russian diplomats in two days after Bucha killingsRead more The British reticence to act came despite an effective warning from the UK foreign secretary, Liz Truss, that the west’s relations with Vladimir Putin’s Russia were over. Truss told a Nato foreign ministers’ dinner that the Nato-Russian Founding Act, the basis of cooperation between Moscow and Nato, was at an end. She said: “The age of engagement is over. We need a new approach to security in Europe based on resilience, defence and deterrence. “There is no time for false comfort. Russia is not retreating but regrouping and repositioning to push harder for the east and south of Ukraine.” Truss added that this would require a new approach to those countries that might be at risk of being ensnared in Russia’s web – Moldova, Georgia, Finland and Sweden. That may require expending more diplomatic resources to monitor and analyse Russia, and some diplomats claim expulsions of Russian diplomats from the UK will only lead to tit-for-tat expulsions from an already denuded Moscow embassy. In 2018 Britain expelled 23 Russian diplomats after Moscow refused to explain how a Russian-made nerve agent was used on Sergei Skripal, a former spy, in Salisbury. Russia responded to the UK’s actions by saying the British and Russian embassies must be of equal size, requiring more than 50 British diplomats to leave. The UK does not disclose the size of its embassy in Russia, but it is known the previous expulsions stripped the UK of much political intelligence and research expertise. Canada’s prime minister, Justin Trudeau, became the western leader who was most willing to articulate the case for continued diplomatic relations, saying that if Canada expelled Russians, Moscow was bound to implement reciprocal measures – thus reducing the number of Canadian eyes and ears in Russia. “I am just not sure the symbolic gesture of excluding Russian diplomats from what they are doing in Canada is worth the cost of losing our diplomats in Moscow,” he said. In the last seven days Poland has expelled 45 Russian diplomats, Germany 40, France 35, Slovenia 33, Italy 30, Spain 25, Belgium 21, the Netherlands 17, Denmark 15, Latvia 13, Greece 12, Portugal 10, Estonia seven, Ireland four, Sweden three, the Czech Republic one and Luxembourg one. Lithuania said it was expelling the Russian ambassador. The expulsions have come in two waves, some in mid-March, but a large crop after pictures of alleged Russian war crimes circulated. A continued refusal of the UK to join its European allies has already drawn criticism from the Labour party, given how much store the UK placed in the act of solidarity by other western embassies in the wake of the Skripal poisoning. Those expulsions were backed by Donald Trump, who threw out 60 Russian diplomats. In total 29 western countries expelled 145 Russian diplomats.

It comes after the US, UK and EU unveiled a raft of new sanctions targeting Russian banks and the country’s elites. The US measures include a ban on investing in Russia as well as sanctions on president Vladimir Putin’s adult daughters. The EU sanctions include a ban on coal imports and restrictions on banks.  “This package has a spectacular look. But this is not enough,” Zelenskiy said in his nightly address. As Ukraine war enters new phase, can western arms turn the tide?Read more “If there is no really painful package of sanctions against Russia and if there is no supply of weapons … it will be considered by Russia as a permission. A permission to attack,” he said, calling for the west to reject Russian oil and completely block the country’s banks from the international finance system. Zelenskiy also said, without providing evidence, that Russian troops were now trying to cover up atrocities in Ukraine. Grisly images of dead civilians in the streets of Bucha this week sparked international condemnation and calls for Russian forces to be tried for war crimes. The UN general assembly will vote on Thursday on whether to suspend Russia from the UN premier human rights body in the wake of the discoveries. Russia has denied responsibility and suggested the images were fake or the deaths occurred after its troops pulled out. However, satellite images show that bodies were lying on streets in Bucha for days before Russian troops left the town. “Russia’s participation on the Human Rights Council is a farce,” US ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield said this week. In other developments: The Pentagon said a “small number” of Ukrainian soldiers are being trained in the United States to operate the deadly Switchblade drones that Washington is supplying to Kyiv. The troops were already in the US before Russia invaded.
Pentagon press secretary John Kirby offered some optimism about the Ukraine resistance. “Of course, they can win this. And if you look at what they’ve been able to do just thus far, Mr Putin has achieved exactly zero of his strategic objectives inside Ukraine,” he said.
Nato foreign ministers will meet in Brussels on Thursday for two days of talks on providing support to bring an end to the war.
US sanctions against two of Russia’s largest banks are “a direct blow to the Russian population [and] ordinary citizens”, Tass news agency cited Russia’s US ambassador as saying on Wednesday. Anatoly Antonov made his remarks after Washington hit Sberbank and Alfabank. Ahead of an expected Russian military assault in the coming days, Ukraine has urged civilians to leave the east of the country “while the opportunity still exists”. The deputy prime minister, Iryna Vereshchuk, said the authorities would “not be able to help” residents who stayed behind once large-scale fighting erupted. She said the governors of the Kharkiv, Luhansk and Donetsk regions were calling on people to move immediately to safer areas. “It has to be done now, because later people will be under fire and face the threat of death. There is nothing they will be able to do about it,” she posted on Telegram. The deputy prime minister emphasised: “It is necessary to evacuate as long as this possibility exists. For now, it still exists.” The Kremlin has said it intends to seize the entire Donetsk region, amid reports that Putin is keen to declare victory in Ukraine in time for 9 May, the annual commemoration of the Soviet defeat of Hitler in the second world war. One western official said Putin would want to have an “announceable success” by then, which could create “some tension” with Russian commanders as exhausted forces were likely to be thrown into battle fairly soon in an attempt to gain ground in the east. The new focus on the east follows the humiliating failure of Putin’s original apparent plan to seize the capital, Kyiv, overthrow the Zelenskiy government and subjugate most of Ukraine in a matter of days or weeks. Instead, Russian troops who advanced on Kyiv were forced to withdraw to Belarus after shattering losses. The Kremlin has also pulled its forces out of the Sumy region after its advance there became bogged down. According to revised estimates, 29 of Russia’s battalion tactical groups – the smallest operating unit of its forces – are now “combat non-effective”, from an invading force estimated to be at about 125 battalions, which comprises around 75% of Russia’s total army. Map Nato and western analysts believe Russia is now determined to consolidate its gains in the south and south-east, with the Kremlin “reshaping its narrative” so that it can redefine its idea of victory. It already controls a land corridor stretching from Mariupol along the sea of Azov to the southern Kherson province and to Crimea. Its next targets appear to be the strategic towns of Sloviansk, which Russian forces and separatists held in 2014, Kramatorsk and Sievierodonetsk. Any assault is likely to run into major resistance from the Ukrainian army.

Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, called on Nato allies to supply more weapons to bolster Ukraine’s war effort, including war planes, heavy air defence systems, missiles and armoured vehicles. Speaking at Nato headquarters, where foreign ministers of member states are meeting later on Thursday, Kuleba said three items were on his agenda for when he talked to the allies and held bilateral meetings: “Weapons, weapons and weapons”. The UN general assembly will vote later on Thursday on whether to suspend Russia from the UN human rights council.
Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said the new package of western sanctions against Russia were “not enough” and without more painful measures and supply of weapons, Russia would view the actions as permission to launch a new bloody attack.
Russia’s defence ministry said it used missiles to destroy four fuel storage facilities in the Ukrainian cities of Mykolaiv, Kharkiv, Zaporizhzhia and Chuhuiv. The ministry said the facilities were used by Ukraine to supply its troops near the cities of Mykolaiv and Kharkiv and in the Donbas region in the south-east of the country.
Russian air attacks are now focused mainly on areas of eastern Ukraine and Russian forces are trying to encircle Ukrainian troops in the region, according to the Ukrainian presidential adviser Oleksiy Arestovych.
At total of 10 humanitarian corridors will be open for civilian evacuations across Ukraine today, but Ukraine’s deputy prime minister Iryna Vereshchuk said residents trying to leave Mariupol would again have to use their own vehicles. The mayor of Mariupol said more than 100,000 people still needed urgent evacuation from the city, and that more than 5,000 civilians, including 210 children, had been killed since the start of Russia’s invasion.
The Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said the US supplying Ukraine with weapons would “not contribute to the success of Russian-Ukrainian talks”.
Poland’s deputy foreign minister Marcin Przydacz said the country needed financial assistance over the arrival of 2.5 million of Ukrainian refugees, many of them children.
The Greek foreign minister, Nikos Dendias, said Athens would ask the international court of justice at The Hague to investigate war crimes in Mariupol.
Ukraine and Hungary again exchanged barbed words. Ukraine’s foreign ministry said it considered Hungary’s willingness to pay for Russian gas in roubles an “unfriendly act”. Hungary’s foreign minister, Péter Szijjártó, confirmed that fuel for his country’s nuclear power plants had arrived by air from Russia, and restated that Budapest did not support proposals for European energy sanctions against Russia.
Defence ministers from Black Sea coastal countries held a video call to discuss the war in Ukraine, mines floating in the sea and regional security, the Turkish defence ministry said, adding that the ministers called for an immediate ceasefire.
Russia’s communications watchdog said it was taking punitive measures against Google, including a ban on advertising the platform and its information resources, for allegedly violating Russian law. Roskomnadzor accused YouTube of being one of the “key platforms” it claimed was spreading fake information about Russia’s conduct in the war.
YouTube suspended the account of Wang Jixian, a Chinese national in Odesa who has criticised Vladimir Putin’s war in Ukraine. He was reported to the platform for content containing “suspected violence”.
The number of alleged Russian war crimes Ukraine says is under investigation has increased to 4,820, according to a recent update from the country’s prosecutor general’s office.

One came down to the cellar and saw us. He said to be quiet. He said he was a nice guy but his colleagues would get us on our knees and shoot us. They took our phones and said ‘no fires’, as if we could make some sort of signal.” Zinaida, 62, lives at No 31, and has been in her cellar since 5 March. She faces the prospect of telling her daughter that her husband is dead, killed by soldiers after going to pick up some items up from a neighbour’s house. “He walked just 20 metres from the house and the Russians killed him. No warning, no reason … How can I tell them?” If you want to read more about Bucha, journalist Nataliya Gumenyuk has written about how the atrocities there have changed the way Ukrainians look at the war.

There he found evidence of summary executions, torture and systematic looting during a month of occupation. Yet residents described an initial sense of guilt among Russian soldiers. “We were scared of them, but after a while we started pitying them. They had dirty faces, they stank and they looked completely lost,” says Yana Lugovets, who spent a month sleeping in the basement with her husband, daughter and friends. She said a soldier who had come to search the house they were staying in left without completing the task, his eyes filled with shame as her daughter cried out in fear at the intruder. Daria Sasina said soldiers who had broken into the beauty salon she ran were apologetic, saying: “Listen, I’m sorry. We didn’t know it would be like this.” However, after the Ukrainian army called in strikes, the Russians became more and more angry.

Photograph: Anastasia Taylor-Lind/The Guardian When rape is used as a weapon Investigators are uncovering the scale of sexual violence committed in Ukraine, including gang-rapes, assaults at gunpoint, and rapes committed in front of children, writes Bethan McKernan in Lviv. Rape and sexual assault are considered war crimes, and both Ukraine’s prosecutor general and the international criminal court have said they will open investigations. “Every break between curfew and bombing I was looking for emergency contraception instead of a basic first aid kit,” said Antonina Medvedchuk in Kyiv, who woke up to the sound of bombing on the day the war broke out. “My mother tried to reassure me: ‘This is not a war like that, they don’t exist any more, they are from old movies.’” Local authorities and organisations have been distributing medical, legal and psychological support and trying to find safe shelters for women and girls fleeing both the war and domestic violence. But the fighting has hampered the effort. “We have had several calls to our emergency hotline from women and girls seeking assistance, but in most cases it’s been impossible to help them physically. We haven’t been able to reach them because of the fighting,” said Kateryna Cherepakha, the president of charity La Strada Ukraine.

After Joe Biden called for the prosecution of Vladimir Putin for war crimes following the discovery in Bucha of mass graves and bodies of bound civilians shot at close range, David Smith explained that bringing the Russian president to trial would be far from simple. The US, China, Russia and Ukraine are not members of the international criminal court, but dozens of prominent lawyers and politicians, including the Ukrainian foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, and the former British prime minister Gordon Brown, have launched a campaign to create a special tribunal to try Russia for the crime of aggression in Ukraine. Models include the tribunals set up to prosecute war crimes committed during the Balkan wars in the early 1990s and during the 1994 Rwanda genocide. Even if it does go ahead, prosecution could take many years. People in Sofia demonstrate holding the Ukrainian national flag during a march in support of Ukraine.

I heard cries and screams,” Yurin said. “I saw bodies and bits of bodies. I pulled one woman out, then a girl, and then a boy. All were hurt. The boy’s legs didn’t move. He was screaming. My hands were shaking. I was covered in blood.” Yurin’s plan involved wading into the frigid sea of Azov with four five-litre plastic bottles, for use as buoyancy aids, and swimming for two-and-a-half hours. His remarkable journey took him to the village of Melekine, where he staggered out of the sea and was rescued by an elderly couple who gave him vodka and borscht.

Dan Sabbagh examines how Nato countries have been gradually stepping up their supply of weapons to Kyiv as the war in Ukraine enters a new phase and asks if the gradual escalation in arms deliveries can avoid a Russian retaliation and turn the tide on the battlefield. The next phase of the war – which could yet be decisive – is expected to unfold in the Donbas in the next month as Russian forces seek to capture Mariupol, create a land bridge to Crimea, expand the area of occupation in the self-proclaimed republics in Donetsk and Luhansk – and perhaps encircle Ukraine’s main fighting force ranged against it. It is a struggle that will unfold over the course of April, but it is probably not until the end of April that a clearer picture will emerge of the revised military balance. Meanwhile, the west’s aims are becoming less clear. Is the goal to allow Ukraine to force the Kremlin into peace talks – or try to inflict a more heavy defeat that would risk provoking an unpredictable Russian president?

The comments came as Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy foreshadowed the emergence of more atrocities, saying the situation in the town of Borodianka was “much more disastrous” than in Bucha.  Moscow’s six-week long incursion has seen more than 4 million people flee abroad, killed or injured thousands, turned cities into rubble and led to sweeping sanctions on Russian leaders and companies. In a symbolic move, the United Nations general assembly suspended Russia from the UN human rights council, expressing “grave concern at the ongoing human rights and humanitarian crisis”. Russia then quit the council. 02:13'You don't resign after you're fired': Russia quits human rights council after suspension – video Russian disinformation surged on social media after invasion of Ukraine, Meta reportsRead more Moscow has previously acknowledged its attack has not progressed as quickly as it wanted, but on Thursday Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov lamented the rising death toll. “We have significant losses of troops,” he told Sky News. “It’s a huge tragedy for us.” Russia is facing its most difficult economic situation for three decades due to unprecedented western sanctions, its prime minister Mikhail Mishustin said. The US Congress removed its “most favoured nation” trade status from Russia in a further blow. Kyiv has called for more heavy weaponry from its western allies and “ruinous” sanctions against Moscow, saying the scale of any impending Russian assault on eastern Ukraine would remind Nato members of the second world war. “Either you help us now – and I’m speaking about days, not weeks – or your help will come too late, and many people will die,” Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, told a meeting of his counterparts in the alliance in Brussels on Thursday. Kuleba said he expected Nato members to send Kyiv the weapons it needed, including air defence systems, artillery, armoured vehicles and jets, but insisted they must act fast while Moscow refocuses its offensive on the Donbas region. “I think the deal that Ukraine is offering is fair. You give us weapons; we sacrifice our lives, and the war is contained in Ukraine. This is it.” 01:13Donbas battle will be like second world war, Ukraine tells Nato – video Nato’s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, said the alliance had agreed to strengthen support for Ukraine, was providing “a wide range” of weapon systems, and would also provide cybersecurity assistance and equipment to protect against chemical and biological threats. With peace talks between Russia and Ukraine continuing by video, Turkey, which has hosted two meetings between the sides, said images of what appeared to be deliberate civilian killings in Bucha and towns in the Kyiv area had “overshadowed” negotiations and ruined an “emerging positive atmosphere”. Pictures and video of dead civilians, some with their hands bound, in the streets of Bucha after it was recaptured from Russian invaders have sparked international revulsion and renewed calls from Ukraine for more weapons and tougher sanctions. On Thursday, Zelenskiy said the situation in the town of Borodianka was “much worse” than Bucha. “The work to clear the rubble in Borodianka has begun … it’s significantly more dreadful there. Even more victims from the Russian occupiers,” he said in a video posted on the Telegram messaging service. The town is about 15 miles (24km) from Bucha. Video from Borodianka showed search and rescue teams using heavy equipment to dig through the rubble of a building that collapsed. Hundreds of people were feared buried. 01:13Drone footage shows scale of destruction in Borodyanka in Ukraine – video Zelenskiy also warned that Russia was preparing “propaganda scenarios”, in which Russian troops would make it look like Ukrainian soldiers were responsible for the deaths of civilians in Mariupol. Pro-Russian authorities in Mariupol said on Thursday that 5,000 people had been killed in the besieged southern city. “Around 60-70% of the housing stock has been destroyed or partially destroyed,” said Konstantin Ivashchenko, who separatists in the breakaway Donetsk region have claimed is now the mayor of Mariupol. Ukrainian authorities had put forward a “conservative” estimate of 5,000 dead in the city, which they say is 90% destroyed, while indicating that there could be “tens of thousands of civilian casualties”.

Fox News reporter Benjamin Hall, who was injured an attack in Kyiv, has posted on Twitter about his injuries, saying he has lost half of one leg and a foot. He paid tribute to his colleagues killed in the attack, producer Oleksandra Kuvshynova and cameraman Pierre Zakrzewski. Russia launched what it calls a “special military operation” on 24 February to demilitarise and “denazify” Ukraine. Kyiv and its western allies reject that as a false pretext. The EU’s ambassadors agreed a fifth sanctions package on Russia with a coal embargo containing a 120-day wind-down period to give member states time to find alternative suppliers, following pressure from Germany to delay the measure. Ukraine accused Hungary of undermining EU unity after Budapest said it was prepared to pay roubles for Russian gas, a Kremlin demand that most in the west had resisted. On the battlefield, Ukraine says after withdrawing from Kyiv’s outskirts, Russia is regrouping to try to gain full control over the eastern regions of Donetsk and Luhansk, which have been partly held by Russian-backed separatists since 2014. The besieged southern port of Mariupol, where more than 100,000 people are believed to be still trapped, was also a target. Both sides have continued to trade accusations, with Moscow opening a criminal investigation into a Russian soldier’s allegations that he was beaten and threatened with death while being held in Ukraine as a prisoner of war.

After the meeting on Saturday, the prime minister said: “Ukraine has defied the odds and pushed back Russian forces from the gates of Kyiv, achieving the greatest feat of arms of the 21st century.  “It is because of president Zelenskiy’s resolute leadership and the invincible heroism and courage of the Ukrainian people that Putin’s monstrous aims are being thwarted. I made clear today that the United Kingdom stands unwaveringly with them in this ongoing fight, and we are in it for the long run. “We are stepping up our own military and economic support and convening a global alliance to bring this tragedy to an end, and ensure Ukraine survives and thrives as a free and sovereign nation.” No 10 said Britain would send 120 armoured vehicles and new anti-ship missile systems to Ukraine. The missiles can do serious damage to Russian warships and could be used to tackle the Russian navy siege of Black Sea ports. The UK pledged £100m in military assistance last week, including another 800 anti-tank missiles, more anti-aircraft weapons, “suicide drones”, which hover over the battlefield before attacking a target, and helmets, body armour and night-vision goggles. Johnson has been praised by Zelenskiy, who contrasts the fulfilment of a promise to deliver vital anti-tank weapons to its army with the more timid responses from other Nato member countries such as Germany.

Photograph: Fadel Senna/AFP/Getty Images The security situation in Ukraine’s capital has stabilised since Russia withdrew from its positions around the city on 29 March to regroup its forces and consolidate territorial gains in Ukraine’s south and east. European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen also visited Ukraine’s capital on Friday, as well as the nearby town of Bucha, where overwhelming evidence suggests that civilians were raped and murdered by Russian troops. Johnson’s visit comes a day after Zelenskiy called on western allies to provide more military aid and step up sanctions on Russia in the wake of a missile attack on a train station in the eastern city of Kramatorsk that killed 52 people, including five children. Russia’s defence ministry has denied responsibility for the strike, but western intelligence officials believe a Russian short-range ballistic missile was fired indiscriminately towards the town centre. At the time of the attack the station was packed with civilians who had been ordered by the Ukrainian government to evacuate the town in the face of the Russian advance from the south-east. “I have already left Kramatorsk, because when a missile hit a school very close to my house, we were very scared,” said Sofiya Ruban, 17, who fled to the Kyiv area with her family. “When we heard about yesterday’s airstrikes at the railway station we were shocked and very saddened.” Russian shelling and missile attacks have intensified in several areas across eastern Ukraine as Moscow moves its “special military operation” away from toppling the government to focus on building a corridor connecting the Russian-occupied region of Crimea with Luhansk and Donetsk – also de-facto controlled by Moscow – with the Russian mainland. The besieged city of Mariupol, together with the southern city of Mykolaiv, which has faced significant shelling, are major Kremlin targets, the UK Ministry of Defence has said. With trains not running out of Kramatorsk on Saturday, panicked residents boarded buses or looked for other ways to get out, fearing the kind of unrelenting assaults and occupations by Russian invaders that delivered food shortages, demolished buildings and death to other cities in Ukraine. Zelenskiy called the station attack the latest example of war crimes by Russian forces and said it should motivate the west to do more to help his country defend itself.“All world efforts will be directed to establish every minute of who did what, who gave what orders, where the missile came from, who transported it, who gave the command and how this strike was agreed,” Zelenskiy said in his nightly video address. In response to the shelling of Kramatorsk, a curfew in the southern port city of Odesa went into effect on Saturday evening until Monday evening. Ten humanitarian corridors to evacuate people from embattled areas across the country had been agreed on Saturday, Ukraine’s deputy prime minister Iryna Vereshchuk said, but by nightfall it was unclear whether civilians had been able to make it to Ukrainian-controlled territory. Several attempts to evacuate 150,000 people still in Mariupol, which has been under constant fire since 24 February, and bring in vital provisions such as food and medicine, have ended in failure after Russian shelling of safe routes. Two UN agencies also called for urgent action to help an estimated 1,000 seafarers stranded in Ukrainian ports and waters with dwindling supplies. The US-based Institute for the Study of War said that Ukrainian forces retain control of defensive positions in eastern and south-western Mariupol, and Russian forces are continuing to attempt to redeploy units in eastern Ukraine. Russian forces are “unlikely to enable a Russian breakthrough and face poor morale”, ISW said. Last week, Dmitry Peskov, a Kremlin spokesperson, said the country had “significant losses of troops and it’s a huge tragedy for us”.

There are two key elements necessary to charge a commander-in-chief with war crimes. First are the crimes themselves. Second, the chain-of-command to the top. In the case of Russia’s Ukraine invasion, both seem clear.  The horrors of Bucha and a slew of towns north of Kyiv are gruesome and widespread. They are also, crucially, being recorded in real time. A major problem for war crimes trials in the past was that evidence had to be sifted from chaotic battlefields years after the fact. This is not the case here. Ukraine’s own investigators are already on the ground, alongside specialists from The Hague. Last month the ICC opened an online evidence portal, inviting ordinary Ukrainians to become part of the investigation process. Russia is not a member of the ICC, but Ukraine has given the court jurisdiction for crimes on its territory, no matter who commits them. The first stage of an indictment is to match evidence of atrocities to records showing which units committed them. For this, video of shattered Russian tanks and abandoned camps will be scrutinised to see which formations were at the scene of the crime. Tiny details can be important, such as graffiti left by a retreating unit, information from abandoned laptops or regimental flashes on discarded uniforms. Nato can play a role here by giving access to intelligence it has collected. Last week Germany’s security service, the BND, released chilling intercepts to its parliament. They included a blunt instruction from one Russian commander: “First question the soldiers, then shoot them.” Spy planes and satellites have kept track of Russia’s order of battle, some of it gleaned from Russians themselves. As the BND has found, many Russian headquarters give orders in the clear. The United States is not an ICC member, but Congress has passed a bipartisan resolution calling for cooperation with the court, which should release an avalanche of information. War crimes evidence works like a mosaic. Prosecutors combine forensics with witness accounts, video and intelligence to produce a complete picture of the crimes and who committed them. When prosecutors have established a pattern of atrocities, the next step is moving up the command chain. Normally this is difficult. The two most high-profile war crimes trials of recent years, against Serbia’s Slobodan Milošević and Liberia’s Charles Taylor, had problems linking these leaders to ragtag militias operating in distant forests and mountains. Former Yugoslav president Slobodan Milošević, flanked by UN guards, in a courtroom of the war crimes tribunal in The Hague in 2002. Photograph: Fred Ernst/EPA By contrast, Russia’s chain of command needs no investigation because it is a matter of public record. Its military regulations set out the responsibilities of its generals, while Article 87 of the constitution names the president as supreme commander of the armed forces. War law gives no immunity to presidents, as Milošević and Taylor found out. Nor is responsibility diluted the further up the command chain you go. If anything, the supreme commander is the most responsible, because he has the most power. The ICC can charge Russia’s high command with war crimes and crimes against humanity without having to prove they ordered these crimes. It is enough to show that crimes happened and commanders did nothing to prevent them, or punish those responsible. Prosecutors are likely to argue that, with its continuing bombardment of Mariupol, Russia has shown no interest in preventing or punishing even the worst atrocities. In the past the ICC has started investigations at the top, rather than first charging lower-level commanders. When it began investigating atrocities in Libya’s Arab spring revolution a decade ago, the country’s leader Muammar Gaddafi was on the very first indictment. Less clear is whether anyone will be charged with genocide. Rightly called the crime of crimes, genocide requires evidence of intent, which is a procedural labyrinth prosecutors may for now avoid. More complicated still is bringing a charge of the crime of aggression. The charge is arguably the easiest to prove, because it refers to any war, such as Russia’s Ukraine invasion, launched in violation of the UN Charter. However, the ICC is not part of the UN. And for this particular charge, ICC rules dictate it cannot indict those from non-member states like Russia. Available evidence suggests that, as with Gaddafi, ICC prosecutors could bring charges against Russia’s top brass in a matter of months. Yet it is possible nobody will ever be brought to trial. The ICC has no police force or ready means to get suspects to The Hague. Western powers could tie existing sanctions to Russia handing over indictees, but that is an uncertain path. For now, investigators labouring amid the mud and blood of Bucha do so despite knowing that justice may never be done.Chris Stephen is the author of Judgement Day: The Trial of Slobodan Milošević (Atlantic Books, 2004)",,,,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e67126ce938c889ce9a498d83b5f195eb8535365/0_331_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=f26998a905c660bad3721b11924a5ead

Both countries are officially non-aligned militarily, but public support for Nato membership has almost doubled since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, to about 50% in Sweden and 60% in Finland, multiple opinion polls suggest.  Sweden’s centre-left Social Democrats, led by prime minister Magdalena Andersson, said their “security review” was about more than just joining the 30-nation alliance, adding that the party could decide to apply even without the backing of members. Having stressed at the outbreak of the war that non-alignment had “served Sweden’s interests well”, Andersson said she was “ready to discuss” the policy in light of Moscow’s aggression, and in late March said she “did not rule out” joining Nato. “When Russia invaded Ukraine, Sweden’s security position changed fundamentally,” the party said in a statement on Monday. The Social Democrat general secretary, Tobias Baudin, said the security review would be complete “before the summer”. The question is expected to be a key issue in parliamentary elections due on 11 September, with centre-right opposition parties already saying they would back a Nato application and the far-right Sweden Democrats also open to the idea. Finland, which shares a 1,340km (830-mile) border with Russia and, like Sweden, is a Nato partner after abandoning its position of strict neutrality at the end of the cold war, is expected to outline its decision regarding the alliance before midsummer. Alexander Stubb, a former prime minister of Finland, told AFP it was “a foregone conclusion” that Helsinki would apply to join Nato, probably in time for a June Nato summit in Madrid. A government-commissioned national security review is due to be delivered to parliament next week to help Finnish MPs decide on the question before they vote, with one recent poll suggesting only six of the country’s 200 MPs were opposed. “We will have very careful discussions, but not taking any more time than we have to,” the country’s prime minister, Sanna Marin, said last week. “I think we will end the discussion before midsummer,” she said. Both countries have received public assurances from the Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, that their applications would be welcome, as well as expressions of support from several members including the US, UK, Germany, France and Turkey. But the move would almost certainly be seen as a provocation by the Kremlin, whose spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, said on Monday that the alliance was “a tool geared towards confrontation” and that their possible accession “will not bring stability to the European continent”.",,,,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c3aa1da5f946586a10be50aa7a217df7a09ab4a5/0_142_5981_3590/master/5981.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=3e1fc835bde6dd2c47c4a0f6d509f905

Starmer has previously suggested Corbyn may be allowed to return to sitting as a Labour MP if he apologises for a statement made in the wake of the equalities’ watchdog report into antisemitism. But speaking to the Guardian on Monday, the Labour leader suggested there was now a bigger obstacle to his return.  “Amongst the very clear changes of the Labour party that I’ve made, one is our approach on antisemitism, where I said I would tear it out by the roots. And that obviously led to the whip being removed from Jeremy Corbyn because of his response to the Equality and Human Rights Commission,” he said. “And the other is to say there is no place in the Labour party for this false equivalence between Russian aggression and Nato, which is why the chief whip wrote letters to the Labour MPs on both those issues. I couldn’t be clearer about the Labour party that I lead.” The Russian invasion of Ukraine prompted Labour’s chief whip to write to all Labour MPs who had signed a Stop the War statement, warning them of disciplinary action if they did not withdraw their names. The former shadow cabinet ministers Diane Abbott and John McDonnell, key Corbyn allies, also withdrew from a Stop the War rally. Keir Starmer accuses Stop the War coalition of siding with Nato’s enemiesRead more Corbyn signed the statement and spoke at the rally. The motion urged Nato to “call a halt to its eastward expansion” and accused the UK government of “sabre-rattling” over Ukraine. He has since told Jacobin he is “horrified at the war in Ukraine, horrified at the loss of life”, but defended Stop the War, saying there was “no evidence that they’ve done anything other than stand up for peace around the world”. Pressed on whether that meant Corbyn could not return until he too had disavowed his association with Stop the War, Starmer said that no one “should be in any doubt” about where Labour stood on both those issues, “on our unshakable support for Nato and on tearing out antisemitism”. He said they were “very clear” requisites for being a Labour MP. “That’s the Labour party I lead.” Corbyn ‘may stand as independent’ if Labour do not restore whipRead more There have been private efforts by some leftwing MPs to bring a resolution to Corbyn’s suspension in recent months, which would have included the offer of a further apology, but sources on both sides have said efforts have reached an impasse. Though Corbyn has been readmitted as a Labour member, Starmer has not allowed him to take the Labour whip, meaning he cannot sit as a Labour MP. In a letter from the chief whip, Corbyn had been told he must commit to supporting the party’s efforts to comply with recommendations by the watchdog and apologise unequivocally for statements made after the critical report. Allies of the former Labour leader have previously suggested they do not believe Starmer’s office was prepared to have discussions in good faith and claim a deal that was negotiated to readmit him after a clarifying statement was never upheld.",,,,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cd56365f3e429288f3bec4e281235c13e0f62227/0_260_2932_1760/master/2932.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=1b564bd71f50e179c1e24343994ae9ae

Soldiers carrying bolt cutters jumped out of the armoured vehicle at the front to clear the road. Then, a deafening bang. In its rush to victory, the advancing party had neglected to check the sandy terrain underneath the roadblock for mines. Luckily, for them, this was merely a dress rehearsal for a showdown between Russia and the North Atlantic alliance.  No live explosives were used in Nato’s “Rising Griffin” manoeuvre at the Pabradė military base in eastern Lithuania. Instead, referees politely informed the tank commanders that their vehicles would have been ripped to shreds. The Russian enemy was being impersonated by American and Norwegian troops. Germany prepares to beef up Lithuania force to show solidarity in Ukraine crisisRead more The western defenders may have notched up a tactical victory against an eastern aggressor on this sunny April morning, yet Nato’s security architecture has never looked more fragile than in the spring of 2022, especially when viewed from Lithuania, a country long considered the alliance’s achilles heel. An independent republic since 1990, the southernmost of the three Baltic states borders both Russia-allied Belarus on its eastern side and the Russian exclave of Kaliningrad on its western flank. On Russian television, pundits have openly urged the Kremlin to escalate the war in Ukraine by enforcing a military corridor along the “Suwalki gap” – Lithuania’s short border with Poland – thus cutting off the Baltics from other Nato-allied lands. “Until last November, we had the Russian army quite far away from Nato’s borders,” said Gabrielius Landsbergis, Lithuania’s foreign minister. “Now the military activity is very close. To add to that, Lithuania lies between the territory of Belarus and the territory of Kaliningrad. Which puts us in a strategic situation that is, let’s say, interesting.” Since 2016, after Russia’s annexation of Crimea, “enhanced forward presence” battlegroups have been stationed in four member states on Nato’s eastern flank: Poland, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. Map The war in Ukraine has led the alliance to further bolster its presence in the region, with multinational battalions to be dispatched to Romania, Bulgaria, Hungary and Slovakia. The military presence in Lithuania has been increased from approximately 1,200 to roughly 1,600 soldiers and equipped with new hardware, such as the German army’s light and mobile Ozelot anti-aircraft system, which can be used to protect airports from aerial assaults. But the function of these military units remains that of a “tripwire”: a reminder to hardliners in the Kremlin that invading what they may see as renegade breakaway nations of a former Russian empire would automatically trigger a military conflict with other western European states. But in their current state, there is little doubt the enhanced forward presence units would sooner or later be overrun. The scenario being rehearsed in the Rising Griffin exercise was a David v Goliath one, with the attacking force taking the role of the giant. The priority of Nato’s troops in the manoeuvre, said one officer, was to “delay the enemy”, not to hold the line. As Nato members prepare to meet in Madrid in June, Lithuania, along with its Baltic neighbour Estonia, is calling on Nato to urgently adjust its posture in the region from deterrence to what it calls “forward defence”. “What we’re seeing in Russia and Belarus is now a dangerous country with the intention to attack other sovereign states,” Landsbergis told the Guardian. “It’s a double-edged sword: on the one hand Russia has proven in Ukraine that it is a declining regional power. On the other hand, it can still do a lot of damage on its way down, as it seems to have no regard for its own losses. We have to defend the Baltic states, especially those that are geographically interesting to Russia.” In keeping with the “founding act”, a political agreement signed by Nato and Russia in 1997, there are restrictions on how many western allied troops are allowed to be deployed to the Baltics, and how close they can be stationed to the border. The enhanced forward presence in Lithuania, which is made up of seven European nations and led by Germany’s Bundeswehr, has to be rotated every six months at considerable cost and effort, with hundreds of vehicles having to be transported by road, rail or air before each changeover. While countries such as Germany and the UK remain committed to the founding act, Lithuania and other states in the region say the document is no longer viable as a treaty. “We consider it null and void after what Russia has done,” Landsbergis said. “The new reality we have to accept is that the treaties that built the old security environment with Russia are no more. We have to look at this with new eyes. There has to be a permanent military presence with everything needed to defend the skies, defend the seas and defend the land of the Baltic states.” Estonia’s prime minister last week called for the three Baltic states to be handed “war-fighting capabilities”, with divisions of up to 25,000 soldiers per country. “The question we have to ask ourselves is: what will be the new global security architecture of the world after this war?” said Landsbergis. “At the moment, we are merely reacting to what is happening in Ukraine. But that has to change. We have to start thinking in strategic terms.”",,,,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/71e28dde051a7fe88753a95e90e357f8838460ae/0_272_4096_2459/master/4096.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=b01c43d684d204df8d4d02e3f4ea05cd

Le Pen, who is polling at 45% to Emmanuel Macron’s 55% for the presidential runoff vote on 24 April, called the press conference on foreign policy to try to take the spotlight off her previous close relationship with Vladimir Putin, which has led to claims from Macron that she was “complacent” and “financially dependent” on the Kremlin. Le Pen said any talk of her betraying French interests or being indebted to Putin was “inaccurate and particularly unjust”. As she spoke, a protester stood up holding a heart-shaped picture of Le Pen and Putin shaking hands at the Kremlin in 2017. The protester was tackled to the ground by security guards and dragged out along the floor. In 2014, Le Pen’s party – then called the Front National, and since renamed National Rally – borrowed €9m from a Russian-Czech bank for local election campaigns. It is still paying off the loan. Five years ago when Le Pen also faced Macron in the 2017 runoff, which she lost heavily, Putin hosted her at the Kremlin, posing for a handshake. At the time, Le Pen declared admiringly that she shared the same values as Putin and that a “new world order” was emerging with Putin, Donald Trump and her at the helm. She has changed tack on Russia since the outbreak of war, condemning the invasion of Ukraine and saying she is independent of any foreign nation, and she has tried to shift attention on to the domestic price of sanctions, inflation, energy costs and the cost of living crisis. At the press conference she said: “I only ever defended the interests of France.” She said her approach was very similar to Macron’s, since he had built up a personal relationship with Putin and pursued dialogue with him, inviting him to the Palace of Versailles and to his summer residence on the Mediterranean. Le Pen said better ties with Russia would prevent Moscow from becoming too close to China, noting that she was echoing an argument made by Macron in the past. On defence, Le Pen said: “I would place our troops neither under an integrated Nato command nor under a future European command,” adding that she would refuse any “subjection to an American protectorate”. In the final weeks before what is expected to be a close vote, the pro-Europe Macron has savaged Le Pen on foreign policy grounds, attacking her for nationalism and friendships with rightwing leaders. He told a rally in Strasbourg this week that “nationalism is war”. Le Pen has changed her policy on Europe from five years ago when she pushed for France to leave the EU and the euro. But Macron has said her proposed changes to treaties, dismantling of rules and cuts to budget contributions would mean France was pushed out of the EU. “She wants to leave but she doesn’t dare say it,” Macron said, accusing his opponent of wanting to strike a special alliance with the right in Hungary and Poland. Le Pen took a loan from a Hungarian bank for the campaign, and told the press conference that French banks had refused to lend to her. Le Pen said she did not want “Frexit” but a looser version of the EU. “Nobody is against Europe,” she said. “I would not stop paying France’s contribution to the EU, I want to diminish it.” But she said the UK’s Brexit had been a big success. She said the French “ruling political class” had been proved wrong after it predicted a “cataclysm for the English”. She said: “The British got rid of the Brussels bureaucracy, which they could never bear, to move to an ambitious project of global Britain.” But she added: “This is not our project. We want to reform the EU from the inside.” Le Pen insisted she wanted to keep a close relationship with Germany, but then launched a stinging attack on their strategic differences, which she said would mean putting an end to a series of Franco-German joint military programmes. She said she would continue “reconciliation” with Germany, “without following the Macron-Merkel model of French blindness towards Berlin”.",,,,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d043fc4e1a28cd6d0cc0d1f341da14336dcb2c70/0_177_5306_3183/master/5306.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=f2268add0dc0680499db54bd998e7bfc

The Finnish prime minister, Sanna Marin, said on Wednesday that her country, which shares a 1,300km (810-mile) border with Russia, would decide whether to apply to join the alliance “quite fast, in weeks not months”, despite the risk of infuriating Moscow.  Russia has repeatedly warned both countries against joining Nato and would see any such move as a provocation. The Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, has said that if Finland and Sweden entered Nato, Russia would have to “rebalance the situation” with its own measures. Speaking alongside her Swedish counterpart, Magdalena Andersson, at a joint press conference in Stockholm, Marin said Finland had to be “prepared for all kinds of actions from Russia” and that “everything had changed” when Moscow attacked Ukraine. Sweden and Finland make moves to join NatoRead more “The difference between being a partner and a member is very clear, and will remain so. There is no other way to have security guarantees than under Nato’s deterrence and common defence as guaranteed by the alliance’s article 5,” she said. Article 5, the 30-member alliance’s collective defence cornerstone, states that an attack on one Nato member is an attack on all. It has only been invoked once in the organisation’s history, in response to the 11 September 2001 terrorist attacks. Andersson said there was “no point” in delaying analysis of whether it was right for Sweden to apply for Nato membership. “There is a before and after 24 February,” she said, referring to the date on which Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine. “This is a very important time in history. The security landscape has completely changed. We have to analyse the situation to see what is best for Sweden’s security, for the Swedish people, in this new situation.” A Finnish government white paper, released on Wednesday, on the country’s “fundamentally changed” security environment made no recommendation on Nato but will serve as the basis for a parliamentary debate after Easter. “I think people’s mindsets in Finland, also in Sweden, changed and were shaped very dramatically by Russia’s actions,” Marin said. “This is very clear and that caused a need for a process in Finland to have a discussion about our own security choices.” She said Finland needed “to be very frank about consequences and the risks. There are both short-term and more long-term risks. These risks are there both if we apply and if we do not apply.” A recent opinion poll showed 68% of Finnish respondents were in favour of joining the alliance, more than double the figure before the invasion, with only 12% against. Polling in Sweden suggests a slim majority of Swedes now also back membership. Both countries are officially non-aligned militarily, but became Nato partners – taking part in exercises and exchanging intelligence – after abandoning their previous stance of strict neutrality when they joined the EU in 1995 after the end of the cold war. Finland declared independence in 1917 after more than a century of Russian rule, and its heavily outnumbered army twice fought off Soviet forces during the second world war before ceding some border territory. Sweden has not fought a war for 200 years. Sweden’s ruling centre-left Social Democrats, led by Andersson, this week began debating whether the country should drop its opposition to joining Nato, abandoning a decades-long belief that peace was best kept by not publicly choosing sides. The question is expected to be a key issue in parliamentary elections on 11 September, with centre-right opposition parties already saying they would back a Nato application and the far-right Sweden Democrats also open to the idea. Nato’s ‘achilles heel’: alliance conducts war games in nervous LithuaniaRead more Many commentators expect the two Nordic nations to act in tandem on whether to join, although Finland – widely seen as likely to apply before a Nato summit in Madrid scheduled for June – looks closer than Sweden. A Swedish security policy review is expected to be completed before the end of May and Andersson has said she will await its outcome before making any decisions. However, a positive Finnish decision would put pressure on Sweden to follow suit. Both countries have received public assurances from the Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, that their applications would be welcome, as well as expressions of support from members including the US, UK, Germany and France.

Eventually, however, this war, like all others, will conclude, but not before Russia or Ukraine, perhaps both, become convinced that the losses – in blood and treasure – are unbearable and success beyond reach.  Perhaps Vladimir Putin calculates that Ukrainians’ desire to end their suffering will force them to accept peace on his terms and that if they haven’t yet it’s because he hasn’t pounded their towns and cities enough. But the pain could just as well increase Ukrainians’ determination to keep fighting. Countries have endured horrific hardships in wartime. Putin surely understands this. Like all Russians, he learned as a schoolboy about the sacrifices Soviet civilians and soldiers made during “the great patriotic war”. Before the invasion, he may have believed that Ukrainians lacked that sort of mettle. By now he must know that their tenacity has not eroded and that news of widespread Russian atrocities – in Bucha, Trostyanets and elsewhere – has in fact increased it. Although Ukrainians’ morale could dissipate if significant military defeats make it impossible, or futile, for their army to continue fighting, that has not happened yet. Despite the Russian army’s overwhelming superiority in troops and firepower, Ukraine has inflicted substantial losses. Thousands of Russian troops have been killed and numerous tanks and armored vehicles destroyed. Russian commanders have been forced to abandon the northern offensive aimed at Kyiv. Moreover, because continuing western military aid provides Ukraine’s army the means to keep fighting, President Volodymyr Zelenskiy isn’t under pressure to accept a deal that concedes large swathes of Ukraine’s south and east to Russia. Putin seems confident that something that can be packaged and sold as victory remains feasible And Putin, despite his army’s lackluster performance and the bite of western sanctions, shows no signs of giving up. He seems confident that something that can be packaged and sold as victory remains feasible and that the military setbacks can be overcome. He may be wrong, but don’t count him out just yet. Though we can’t know which side will decide that it cannot continue fighting or when it will reach that conclusion, we are in a better position to anticipate the agenda of a diplomatic endgame and the obstacles to a political settlement. Unless it faces imminent defeat, Ukraine will reject any agreement that does not require Russia to abandon all the territories it has occupied since 24 February. Having endured hell, Ukrainians will denounce as capitulation any deal that does not include that provision unless it is necessary for their country’s survival. The problem is that Putin will insist on terms that enable him to demonstrate to Russians that a war he depicted as essential to safeguarding their country’s security was worth it. Coming home empty-handed will damage his political standing and, barring a turn in the war that’s disastrous for Russia, his calculations won’t change. Then there’s the matter of Ukraine’s postwar status. Before the war, there were proposals for a lengthy moratorium on Ukraine’s membership in Nato, even Ukrainian neutrality. But Russia showed no interest in the former, and Ukraine rejected the latter on various grounds. Nato supported Kyiv’s stance. In the weeks preceding Russia’s invasion, Jens Stoltenberg, Nato’s secretary general, stated, repeatedly, that the decision Nato made at its 2008 Bucharest summit to welcome Ukraine was irrevocable. What he didn’t explain was why Ukrainians were kept waiting for nearly 14 years, angering Russia but leaving Ukraine unprotected at the time of its greatest peril. Because both Ukraine and Nato rejected neutrality, we can’t know whether it would have averted Russia’s invasion. Putin had other demands, but they concerned Nato’s eastern front. What he wanted from Ukraine was a binding renunciation of the Atlantic Alliance. Kyiv insists its neutrality must be guaranteed by countries that commit to defend it from attack Ukrainians have now learned a bitter truth: Nato wasn’t serious about admitting them; its members were too divided to muster the necessary 30-0 vote. Furthermore, rather than having improved Ukraine’s chances for membership, Russia’s invasion may have diminished them. Zelenskiy’s coming to terms with these realities may explain his reconsideration of neutrality. Kyiv has discussed the idea in talks with Moscow but insists that its neutrality must be guaranteed by countries that commit, through a formal agreement, to defend it from attack, including through military intervention. The guarantors mentioned by Ukrainian officials include Nato members: the United States (no surprise there), Britain, Canada, France, Germany and Poland. Their responses have been vague at best. None has declared its willingness to assume the responsibility, and the British have already rejected any pledge resembling Article V of the Nato treaty. Yet having been invaded by Russia, Kyiv won’t embrace neutrality unless it includes an ironclad insurance policy. A political settlement also depends on Nato’s objectives. Will the alliance specify the conditions Russia must fulfill before sanctions can be lifted and agree to lift them, even if in stages, once Moscow delivers? Or will it refuse to clarify terms and timelines? Does Nato seek Russia’s withdrawal from Ukrainian territories occupied after 24 February or to maintain the sanctions indefinitely in order to diminish Russia’s power, and perhaps even precipitate “regime change”? Short of outright military defeat, which is hard to imagine, Russia won’t give something in exchange for nothing. Nato seems divided on these questions. Some members, most likely Poland and the Baltic states, want Ukraine to resist compromises because it is fighting for Europe’s security, not merely its own. But if Nato seizes the war as an opportunity to deliver body blows to Russia it will surely prolong it and increase the number of Ukrainian deaths. Plus, the longer the war continues, the greater the risk that it could spread beyond Ukraine and lead to a clash between Nato and Russia – one in which nuclear weapons could be used. It is within Putin’s power to wind down this war, but what Nato does matters as well.

However, the Lithuanian defence minister, Arvydas Anušauskas, claimed on Thursday that Russia already had nuclear weapons stored in its Baltic exclave of Kaliningrad, which borders Lithuania and Poland. That claim has not been independently verified, but the Federation of American Scientists (FAS) reported in 2018 that nuclear weapon storage bunkers in Kaliningrad had been upgraded.  The Russian former president Dmitry Medvedev, a senior member of Russia’s security council, said on Thursday that all its forces in the region would be bolstered if the two Nordic countries joined the US-led alliance. Medvedev’s threat is the latest of many instances of nuclear sabre-rattling from the Kremlin aimed at deterring western military intervention on behalf of Ukraine. “We’re obviously very concerned,” said the CIA director, William Burns. “Given the potential desperation of President Putin and the Russian leadership, given the setbacks that they’ve faced so far militarily, none of us can take lightly the threat posed by a potential resort to tactical nuclear weapons or low-yield nuclear weapons.” But Burns added: “While we’ve seen some rhetorical posturing on the part of the Kremlin, moving to higher nuclear alert levels, so far we haven’t seen a lot of practical evidence of the kind of deployments or military dispositions that we would reinforce that concern.” Finland and Sweden are deliberating over whether to abandon decades of military non-alignment and join Nato, with the two Nordic countries’ leaders saying Russia’s onslaught on Ukraine has changed Europe’s “whole security landscape”. Their accession to the alliance would more than double Russia’s land border with Nato members, Medvedev said. “Naturally, we will have to reinforce these borders” by bolstering ground, air and naval defences in the region, he said. Map of Nato countries colour-coded by year of accession Medvedev, a close ally of Vladimir Putin, explicitly raised the nuclear threat, saying Finnish and Swedish Nato membership would mean there could be “no more talk of any nuclear-free status for the Baltic – the balance must be restored”. Russia had “not taken such measures and was not going to”, he said. “But if our hand is forced, well … take note it wasn’t us who proposed this.” Russia borders the Baltic states of Estonia and Latvia, and the Russian exclave of Kaliningrad is sandwiched between Poland and Lithuania. Russia’s deputy foreign minister, Alexander Grushko, said Moscow would take the security and defence measures that it would deem necessary if Sweden and Finland join Nato, adding that the move would seriously worsen the military situation and lead to “the most undesirable consequences”. Anušauskas described the Russian threat as “rather strange” because, he said, nuclear weapons “have always been kept” in Kaliningrad. “They keep nuclear weapons, delivery vehicles, and have warehouses,” he told the Baltic News Service. “The international community and countries in the region are perfectly aware of that.” In 2018 the FAS analysed satellite images and concluded that the Russians had carried out a major renovation of what appeared to be “an active nuclear weapons storage site in the Kaliningrad region”. However, the analysts were unable to determine whether nuclear warheads were already being stored there, were imminently about to arrive, or would be moved there in a crisis. “There is indeed a storage site in Kaliningrad, known as Kolosovka. That is where nuclear weapons for all units located in Kaliningrad would be,” said Pavel Podvig, a military expert based in Geneva who runs a research project on Russian nuclear forces. “There are conflicting reports about whether Russia actually has any weapons in Kolosovka. We don’t really know.” Hans Kristensen, the director of the nuclear information project at FAS, said work was still going on at the storage bunkers. “They’re working on security perimeter now. So I doubt there are warheads in there,” Kristensen said. Finland’s prime minister, Sanna Marin, said on Wednesday that Finland, which shares an 810-mile (1,300km) border with Russia, was likely to decide on a Nato application “within weeks”, while her Swedish counterpart, Magdalena Andersson, said there was “no point delaying” the decision. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said Russian forces who have pulled back from northern Ukraine after failing to take the capital were “increasing their activities on the southern and eastern fronts, attempting to avenge their defeats”. The deputy defence minister, Hanna Malyar, said on Thursday that Russia was massing forces along the Russia-Ukraine border, in Belarus and in the breakaway Transdniestria region of Moldova, with the eastern cities of Kharkiv, Donetsk and Zaporizhzhia coming under missile attack. Moldova accused the Russian army of trying to recruit its citizens after British military intelligence said Moscow was attempting to enlist fighters in Transdniestria, a narrow strip of land held by pro-Russia separatists that is within about 25 miles of the Ukrainian port of Odesa. “Such actions do not promote peace for all of us, our fellow citizens, for our families. Such things are very dangerous and they must be stopped,” said the Moldovan foreign minister, Nicu Popescu, without giving further details. The Kremlin did not immediately comment. The chief military development of the day was the loss of Russia’s flagship missile cruiser, Moskva, which sank in “stormy seas” while being towed to a port in the Black Sea after an explosion. The Ukrainian southern military command claimed late on Wednesday to have struck the Moskva with Neptune anti-ship cruise missiles, while distracting its crew with an aerial drone, causing it to start sinking and forcing the crew to abandon ship. Russia’s defence ministry initially denied reports that it had sunk and claimed the fires had been extinguished. Four Russian ships that had gone to the Moskva’s rescue were being hampered by stormy weather and by ammunition blowing up onboard, it said. But late on Thursday, the ministry said in a statement: “The cruiser ship Moskva lost its stability when it was towed to the port because of the damage to the ship’s hull that it received during the fire from the detonation of ammunition. In stormy sea conditions, the ship sank.” The crew had been safely evacuated, but it marks the most significant military loss of a naval vessel since the Argentinian cruiser the General Belgrano was torpedoed by a British submarine in 1982. Moscow said the port of Mariupol was under its full control, but Vadym Denysenko, an adviser to Ukraine’s interior minister, said on Thursday that the battle over the seaport was “still ongoing today”. Mariupol is a key target in Moscow’s push to secure a land corridor between the self-proclaimed republics in Donetsk and Luhansk in Donbas and Crimea, which Russia occupied and annexed in 2014, and its capture would allow the Kremlin’s military planners to redeploy vital resources farther east. Russian officials accused Ukraine of using helicopters to bomb a town in the southern Bryansk region, about 6 miles from the border, saying seven people were injured in shelling and describing the attack as a “deliberate strike on residential buildings”. The claim could not be independently verified. 0Inside Ukraine’s suburban horror: ‘I have nothing left’ - video The Russian retreat from around Kyiv has led to the discovery of large numbers of apparently massacred civilians, drawing international condemnation and calls for a war crimes investigation. The Hague-based international criminal court, which deals with rights abuses, said Ukraine had become a “crime scene”. The ICC’s chief prosecutor, Karim Khan, said on a visit to Bucha, where officials say more than 400 civilians died: “We’re here because we have reasonable grounds to believe that crimes within the jurisdiction of the court are being committed.” Moscow has rejected all reports of atrocities, which Putin has dismissed as “fakes”.

Dvornikov, who has served as commander of the southern military district since 2016, faces a very different set of challenges in Ukraine, where the Russian air force does not control the skies and its ground forces have been seriously depleted by regular supplies of advanced weaponry that was unavailable to Syrian rebels. Putin ‘using weapons smuggled by Iran from Iraq’ Russia is receiving munitions and military hardware sourced from Iraq for its war effort in Ukraine with the help of Iranian weapons smuggling networks, according to members of Iranian-backed Iraqi militias and regional intelligence services with knowledge of the process, write Bethan McKernan and Vera Mironova. RPGs and anti-tank missiles, as well as Brazilian-designed rocket launcher systems, have been dispatched to Russia from Iraq as Moscow’s campaign has faltered in the last month, the Guardian has learned. An Iranian-made Bavar 373 missile system, similar to the Russian S-300, has also been donated to Moscow by the authorities in Tehran, who also returned an S-300, according to a source who helped organise the transport. Using the weapons-trafficking underworld would signal a dramatic shift in Russian strategy, as Moscow is forced to lean on Iran, its military ally in Syria, after new sanctions triggered by the invasion of Ukraine. The developments also have huge implications for the direction and volume of trade in the international weapons trafficking business.

The 45-year-old was among up to 4,000 other civilians at the train station that morning fleeing the advance of Russian troops across the country’s east. The war managed to find them anyway. Before the train to Dnipro pulled in, two ballistic missiles exploded over the railway station building, dropping deadly cluster munitions – illegal under international law because of the indiscriminate damage they cause over a wide area – all over the concourse and baggage hall. “I remember it very clearly. I thought I could hear a plane, and then I was thrown on the floor,” Kovalov said from his hospital bed in the Dnipropetrovsk region. “The first minute was total chaos. The emergency response tents caught fire, cars caught fire. There was blood and smoke everywhere.” Doctors are hopeful Andrei Kovalov will walk again after his legs were lacerated by shrapnel. Photograph: Anastasia Taylor-Lind/The Guardian How conspiracy theory about Ukrainian ‘bioweapons labs’ took off In the hours after Russia invaded Ukraine, a longtime QAnon follower tweeted that approximately 30 US-funded ‘biolabs’ were dotted across Ukraine. Putin’s assault on Ukraine, he theorised, was really about stopping an American-orchestrated biological attack on Russia. He was just remixing an allegation Moscow had made for years: that the US was running a secret bioweapons programme and had Russia in its sights. But from that single tweet, the conspiracy theory quickly spread. Even before Fox News’s Tucker Carlson amplified the theory, the Canadian journalist Justin Ling had been watching it spread across the internet. He told Michael Safi that watching it gain momentum, he could see Russia’s techniques for amplifying disinformation in action.

As Shaun Walker and Andrew Roth write, a few days later she ventured into the village school, where she works as the deputy headteacher, and discovered the Russians had taken most of the computers, the projectors and other electronic equipment. “People saw them simply loading everything on to Ural trucks, everything they could get their hands on,” said Samson. A dozen houses on the village’s main street had been looted, as well as all the shops. Other villagers reported losing washing machines, food, laptops and even a sofa.

A Russian tank is filmed firing on apartments in Mariupol; evidence emerges that a cluster bomb was used to strike against the train station in Kramatorsk and concerns surface about the possible use of phosphorus in Ukraine’s cities. Moscow’s forces have been repeatedly accused of using indiscriminate weapons in cities throughout the seven-week-long Ukraine war, a disregard for civilian life that has already almost certainly led to thousands of unnecessary deaths. Concerns too circulate about an escalation of the conflict through the use of other banned weapons – but this is less certain. Britain’s Ministry of Defence is still investigating a report from earlier this week that chemical weapons were used by Russia in Mariupol, affecting three people.

It may be a boomerang,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/15/putin-thought-ukraine-war-was-a-missile-to-nato-it-may-be-a-boomerang,"It is conceivable that by the end of the year Nato’s land mass, GDP and territorial borders with Russia may expand by nearly as much as they would have if Ukraine had achieved its distant goal of eventual membership of the western defence alliance – if not more. The brutal manner in which Vladimir Putin has tried to foreclose Ukraine’s security options has led to a sudden change in thinking in Finland and Sweden that has been all the more powerful since it seems to have come from below, as opposed to from the political elites.  It is not yet a done deal. Opinion so volatile, and previously so settled in its opposition to Nato membership, could swing back towards the comforts of semi-neutrality. Russian nuclear threats, already starting, may intimidate voters into having second thoughts. The process may be fraught. Many brands of Nato membership exist, and have yet to be fully explored by the Finns and the Swedes. But by Nato’s Madrid summit in June, Nato will be on course to expand its population by 16 million, its GDP by €800bn and its land mass by 780,000 sq km. Ukraine, by contrast, has a population of 41 million, a land mass of 603,000 sq km and a GDP of €155bn. A new 1,300km border with Nato could be formed, the precise opposite of what Putin set out to achieve in the treaties designed to shrink Nato that he ordered the west to accept last year. What is worse for Moscow, Nato could have strengthened itself in the Baltic Sea, right next to Kaliningrad enclave, the strategic Russian naval base. By invading Ukraine, Putin thought he had hurled a missile at the west. It has emerged to be a precision-guided boomerang. To have turned two stolidly non-aligned countries into Nato members would join the pantheon of great strategic blunders of wartime. It is all the more extraordinary since the turnaround has been so rapid. Finland, with its brand of semi-neutrality for the past 70 years and emphasis on consensus-building, tends to shift foreign policy with glacial speed. Finland’s tolerance of Putin was so embedded that some on the left claimed it strayed close to collaboration as the Finnish political elite shunned the Russian opposition. In the government’s annual survey in December, Finnish support for Nato membership stood at 24%. Four months later, Finnish politics has somersaulted. Support for Nato membership stood at 68%. Surveys now show more than half of the 200 parliamentarians back Nato membership. In the 2015 Finnish parliamentary elections, 91% of SDP candidates were opposed to Nato membership. The Finnish SDP prime minister, Sanna Marin, said everything had changed. Russia is “not the neighbour we thought it was”, she said. Alexander Stubb, a former Finnish prime minister, said Finland’s membership is based on rational fear, created on the day of the Russian invasion. He predicts the Finnish application will be with Nato HQ by the end of May. “The train has left the station.” In a speech earlier this month to the council of the largely agrarian Centre party, Annika Saarikko explained that sometimes history moved fast, measured in weeks rather than years: “In the foreseeable future we cannot rely on a mutually agreed to international order or a functioning relationship with Russia for our security.” She added that Nato membership came with obligations. “Finland would not just be buying some fire insurance. It would be joining the central fire brigade.” Such has been the Finnish turnaround, it has adopted the unusual role of exemplar to the larger Sweden. That requires the two countries respecting the relationship, sensitivities, and different political cultures. The ideal from Nato’s perspective is that the two countries join simultaneously, and polls show support for this. But Finnish diplomats say they cannot be seen to be interfering in sovereign Swedish decisions. Marin stressed at her joint press conference in Stockholm with the Swedish prime minister, Magdalena Andersson, that coordination with Sweden “is sought but is not a prerequisite”, adding: “Finland does not dictate schedules or conclusions to Sweden nor does Sweden dictate to Finland.” It is vital for the ruling Social Democrats, now launching an internal policy review, to be seen to be in charge of its own destiny. After all, last November the party had clearly affirmed its position that it opposed a foreign policy of alliances. Yet four centre-right parties now support Nato membership and two parties to the left are opposed to membership, claiming joining Nato implies coming to the defence of the authoritarians running Turkey and Hungary. With parliamentary elections looming in September, the SDP will want the review completed without the party descending into left-right splits. One of the difficulties is that given Russia’s behaviour, no plan B such as greater Swedish-Finnish defence cooperation, or the Nato partnership for peace, looks as concrete as full membership. Most Nato countries see Sweden and Finland as huge military and intelligence assets. “It would complete a missing piece of the puzzle of Nato strategic planning”, said Mika Aaltola, the director of the Finnish Institute of International Affairs. But Finland would have to apply for Nato membership not knowing the precise future relationship. In its security document published this week, Finland insisted: “Membership would not oblige Finland to accept nuclear weapons, permanent bases or troops in its territory. For example, in the early stages of their membership, founding members Norway and Denmark imposed unilateral restrictions on their membership and have not permitted permanent troops, bases or nuclear weapons of the alliance in their territory during peacetime. Nato’s enlargement policy, which took shape in the latter half of the 1990s, has been based on the principle that it will not place nuclear weapons, permanent troops or permanent bases in the territory of any new member country. But if Finland, or indeed Sweden, did set a mass of limiting preconditions concerning nuclear weapons, permanent bases or forces, the application process might be extended. A lengthy accession process in turn carries risks since Russia, using the full spectrum of war’s grey zone, will seek to harass, and even paralyse. On the day the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, spoke to the Finnish parliament, Russia was accused of cyber-attacks and invasions of its airspace. Finland has already canvassed Nato members for security guarantees in the four months to a year that it was in the Nato ante-chamber awaiting full acceptance. So there is an incentive to speed the application without delegitimising the domestic consultation. For those who fear Nato escalating the conflict inside Ukraine, a sudden extension of article 5 obligations in the north remains alarming, and may make Putin even more convinced he was right to confront a Nato policy of encirclement. But for all its talk of red lines and the stationing of nuclear weapons, can Russia really open a second front to the north when the primary front to its south-west is proving so costly in lost lives, reputation and treasure?

Fifty days of Russian invasion, although the occupiers gave us a maximum of five,” he said.
The Russian flagship cruiser Moskva has sunk in the Black Sea off southern Ukraine, according to Russia’s defence ministry. Ukraine claims it was hit by Ukrainian weaponry – the Neptune cruise missile, which Ukraine builds itself. Russia maintains that a fire onboard and then “stormy sea conditions” while it was being towed to port were to blame. Russia has only three of this flagship-class of warship, which have crews of almost 500 sailors, and the loss of the Moskva is a big blow. The former CIA director David Petraeus described Russia’s admission as a “rare moment of truth”, telling the BBC: “I’m surprised that they admitted it.”
Moskva served a “key role as command vessel and air defence node”, the UK’s Ministry of Defence said.
Vladimir Putin may resort to using a tactical or low-yield nuclear weapon in light of military setbacks in the invasion of Ukraine, the CIA director, William Burns, has said. During a speech in Atlanta, Burns said: “Given the potential desperation of President Putin and the Russian leadership … none of us can take lightly the threat posed by a potential resort to tactical nuclear weapons or low-yield nuclear weapons.” The Kremlin placed Russian nuclear forces on high alert shortly after the invasion of Ukraine began on 24 February.
A total of 6,673 alleged war crimes committed by Russian troops in Ukraine are under investigation, Ukraine’s prosecutor’s office has said. 198 children have been confirmed to have been killed, the office added.   Russia’s deputy foreign minister, Alexander Grushko, said Moscow would take “security and defence measures that we will deem necessary” if Sweden and Finland join Nato. In an interview with the Russian state-owned news agency Tass, the minister said the membership in the military alliance would “seriously worsen the military situation” and lead to “the most undesirable consequences”. Finland and Sweden had earlier taken a major step towards joining Nato.
Ukraine’s foreign ministry has appealed to the UN to facilitate the return of Ukrainian children who have been “illegally deported” to Russia. In a statement, the ministry said Russia had “engaged in state-organised kidnapping of children and destruction of the future of the Ukrainian nation”.
France is planning to return its embassy to the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv. It had moved to the western city of Lviv in March as Russia invaded. Volodymyr Zelenskiy has urged allies to resume their normal diplomatic presence in Ukraine.
Zelenskiy further urged European countries to give up Russian oil that provides “blood” money to Moscow, and appealed for more weapons to help Ukraine repel Russia’s invasion.
Nine humanitarian corridors have been agreed for Friday, the Ukrainian deputy prime minister Iryna Vereshchuk has announced. A total of 2,557 people were evacuated from Ukrainian cities through humanitarian corridors on Thursday, Vereshchuk confirmed, with 289 of those from Mariupol. The head of the UN World Food Programme, meanwhile, said people were being “starved to death” in the besieged city.
Armenia has begun making payments for Russian gas in roubles, its economy minister, Vagan Kerobyan, told RBC. “We need to move towards national currencies … As far as I know, the last few payments were in roubles, but at the appropriate rate,” RIA cited Kerobyan as saying.
A Russian legislator and two aides pushed a covert propaganda campaign aimed at winning US government support for Russia’s foreign policy agenda, including moves against Ukraine, according to a Justice Department indictment seen by the Associated Press.

127,,,,"Friday, 15 April 2022",2022-04-15,Spy games: expulsion of diplomats shines light on Russian espionage,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/15/spy-russian-diplomats-europe-espionage-ukraine,"The unprecedented wave of expulsions of Russian diplomats from European capitals – now close to 400 – is not just a symbolic, if reversible, act of revulsion at the war crimes for which Russia stands accused. It is part of a decades long battle to police the dividing line between espionage and diplomacy, one in which the west of late has been accused of too often ignoring a resurgence in Russia’s clandestine activities, either because of an excessive focus on domestic terrorism, or excessive reliance on intercepts. Sir John Sawers, the former head of M16, last year said he suspected the west was picking up only 10% of Russia’s espionage.  The current scale of the exodus of alleged Russian spies – probably the largest single set of such expulsions in history according to the distinguished former French diplomat François Heisbourg – may also raise questions about why the west came to indulge so many Russian “diplomats” working on European soil. By Friday, among the EU member states, only Malta, Cyprus and Hungary had so far declined to send any Russian “diplomats” packing. Heisbourg insisted there was a clear and valid distinction between a diplomat and a spy, and those being expelled from Europe will not be chosen at random but because there is evidence they are in breach of the Vienna convention, the code that governs legitimate diplomacy. As well as spying this could also involve spreading disinformation on social media. “If you spend your time sending Twitter messages insulting the government of the host nation, if you follow the ‘wolf warrior’ diplomacy undertaken by Chinese diplomats, that can fall under that definition of making you persona non grata,” said Heisbourg. Russia’s slow cyberwar in Ukraine begins to escalate, experts sayRead more Heisbourg said there was an art to expulsions. “Self-evidently, it is easier to keep track of the spy that you do know rather than the spy you don’t know. Once you know of their existence, they become useful counter-intelligence. If you don’t know who they are you have a problem.” He recalled that during the so-called Farewell affair in the 1980s a KGB defector, Vladimir Vetrov, gave almost 4,000 secret documents to the DST, the French internal secret service, showing how Russia had penetrated the west to steal its technology. Vetrov also provided a list of 250 intelligence officers stationed under legal cover in embassies around the world. It was only following Vetrov’s arrest in Moscow that France, acting on the dossiers Vetrov provided, acted to expel 40 diplomats, two journalists and five commercial officials. Heisbourg had a role in handling the case and recalled: “Even then, it was useful to keep some names back so we had an A list and a B list that we kept in reserve in case the Russians should take countervailing action. We made it known to the Russians that if they did a tit for tat, they would get hit again many times bigger.” Since the 1980s Heisbourg said he had little doubt that the proportion of spies operating inside the Russian diplomatic service was higher than for most countries. It raises questions, for instance, why 290 Russian diplomats will still be operating in neutral Austria even after the foreign ministry, following days of hesitation, expelled four diplomats. By way of comparison, Austria has about 30 diplomats operating in Moscow. It is true large countries have larger embassies – a prime example is the US embassy in Baghdad – and some of the Russian diplomats in Vienna – possibly 100 – are attached to the many UN institutions in Austria, such as the UN nuclear watchdog the IAEA. But the imbalance of Russian and Austrian interest in one another’s countries is, at best, striking. Poland too may, in retrospect, be wondering why after expelling 45 diplomats on 23 March, it had ever granted diplomatic status to so many Russians in the first place. Stanisław Żaryn, spokesperson for the minister for the special services coordinator, has justified the expulsions by saying “we are neutralising the Russian special services network in our country”, adding that half the expelled diplomats were direct employees of the Russian secret service and half were involved in hostile influence operations.

Photograph: Paweł Supernak/EPA “Russia uses diplomacy not to remain in contact with partners, but to push false claims and false propaganda statements against the west,” Żaryn said. In total, the 45 Russians being thrown out represent about half the Russian diplomatic staff in Warsaw. Wiltshire novichok victim’s family concerned at public inquiry delayRead more Poland also saw the expulsions as a preventive measure. The risk of espionage had risen with the sudden influx of Ukrainians into Poland, potential fertile ground for Russia to stir dissent, recruit agents or pick up information from refugees about military movements. Russia, Żaryn claimed, was intent on “creating hostility within Poland towards Ukrainian refugees fleeing Russia”. Poland is now seizing disused old Russian embassy buildings in Warsaw. Two other countries at the forefront of providing heavy arms to Ukraine – Slovakia and the Czech Republic – have also recently been on the espionage front line with Moscow. On 30 March, Bratislava expelled 35 diplomats, one of the largest single expulsions in the current wave. Only a fortnight before on 14 March Slovakia detained four people suspected of spying for Moscow, and expelled three Russian diplomats in response. Russia had paid the suspects “tens of thousands of euros” for sensitive or classified information. The quality of that information is disputed, but one of the two men charged was pro-rector and the head of the security and defence department at the Armed Forces Academy in the northern town of Liptovsky Mikulas. It has been reported there was evidence of contacts with four officers working for Russia’s GRU military intelligence agency dating to 2013. One of them was Lt Col Sergey Solomasov, a GRU spy. Slovak intelligence filmed Solomasov smoking and talking in a park with Bohuš Garbár, a contributor to a now closed conspiracy website Hlavné Správy. On the video he tells Garbár: “Moscow has decided that you will be a ‘hunter’ for two types of people: those who love Russia and would like to cooperate, who want money, and have confidential information. The second group are your acquaintances who may or may not be thinking about working for Russia. I need political information and communication between countries, within Nato and the EU.” The lines may not be purist Ian Fleming prose, but in an era of technology based espionage, they show spies still depend on a mundane individual’s avarice and mendacity. GRU agents Alexander Petrov and Ruslan Boshirov were linked with the Salisbury novichok poisonings and sabotage at Czech weapons warehouses. Photograph: Metropolitan Police/PA The Czechs also have reason to doubt the bona fides of Russian diplomat. In 2014 a mysterious but massive explosion occurred at a couple of remote Czech weapons warehouses, including one in Vrbětice close to the border with Slovakia that led to two deaths. At the time Ukraine had been in the market for weapons to fight Russia in Donbas. It was not clear if the cause of the explosions was sabotage or incompetence, and the case went cold. But then investigations by the British police, as well as the open-source investigative news outlet Bellingcat, revealed the identity of two suspected GRU agents. The two were Ruslan Boshirov (real name Anatoliy Chepiga) and Alexander Petrov (Alexander Mishkin). These exact same aliases had been allegedly given by two Russians who had visited a hotel near Vrbětice just before the 2014 explosion. Intelligence sources suggested that the planned arms shipments belonged to EMCO, a firm owned by the Bulgarian arms dealer Emilian Gebrev, who was poisoned in an upscale Sofia restaurant in April 2015, just months after the explosion in the Czech Republic. An investigation in 2019 by Bellingcat asserted that another senior GRU officer, Denis Sergeev (aka “Sergey Fedotov”), was in Bulgaria at the time of Gebrev’s poisoning, which he survived. Sergeev is also alleged to have been in the UK around the time of the the novichok poisoning attacks on Sergei and Yulia Skripal in Salisbury. None of this activity, the Czechs concluded, would have occurred without the knowledge of the Russian state. In April last year the then Czech prime minister Andrej Babiš ordered the expulsion of 18 Russian diplomats, asserting GRU Unit 29155 had been behind the destruction of the weapons. Russia retaliated by expelling 20 Czechs, only for the Czechs to increase the expulsions to 60 so equalising the size of the two countries’ diplomatic missions. It was one of the largest single expulsions of Russian diplomats since Ronald Reagan threw out 80 diplomats in 1986 at the height of the cold war. Prague has often been described as a hub for Russian espionage activity across Europe, but no longer. Not surprisingly after the diplomatic carnage of 2021, the Czechs have this spring only expelled one Russian diplomat. In the same vein, Heisbourg said, most European countries are not critical of the British failure to expel diplomats in the wake of “the Bucha massacre”. After throwing out 29 Russian diplomats in the wake of the Skripal poisoning in 2019, Russia’s London embassy is relatively clean, and the UK is anyway reluctant to take a step that would see yet more of its Russian-speaking envoys – a precious resource – sent home from Moscow. But the contrast between the UK and European response has been striking. After the war crimes in Bucha were revealed Germany expelled 40 Russian diplomats, France 35, Spain 25, Slovenia 33, Italy – which had thrown out two Russian spies in 2021 – selected a further 30. France for mysterious reasons then threw out a further six diplomats. Lithuania decided to expel Alexey Isakov, the Russian ambassador himself. As a farewell present someone dyed the lake in front of the embassy blood red. Volunteers in Bucha on the outskirts of Kyiv load bodies of civilians onto a lorry to be taken to a morgue. Photograph: Rodrigo Abd/AP Some, such as Belgium (expelled 21) and the Netherlands (17) took action before news of the Bucha massacre started to circulate. Others agonised. Luxembourg expelled only one Russian, but since there were only three Russian diplomats, it was more than symbolic. A strong theme has been less that the diplomats were spies, but that they were agents of division and disinformation. The German foreign ministry for instance declared 40 persona non grata in the Russian embassy because “they have worked against our freedom, against the cohesion of our society, day after day here in Germany”. Spain simply said the 25 represented a threat to the interests and security of their country. Other European countries have justified the expulsions on grounds of parity. The Slovenian foreign ministry for instance cited article 11 of the Vienna convention. That article confers the receiving state the right to require the foreign diplomatic mission or consular post to keep the size of its mission within reasonable and normal limits. So Slovenia aligned the size of Russia diplomatic mission with its own in Moscow. Since Slovenia has only eight diplomats in Moscow, 33 of the 41 Russian embassy staff in Slovenia have been asked to leave the country. For good measure it has demanded Moscow pay compensation for a Russia missile damaging its mission in Kharkiv. There have also been some curiosities. Austria’s foreign minister, Alexander Schallenberg, said at the beginning of last week he opposed expulsions and insisted Austria needed its eyes and ears. “We do not expel in bulk,” he said grandly, adding the lack of coordination across Europe was regrettable. But by Thursday he executed an inelegant U-turn. One possible reason for the volte face was the re-emergence of stories recalling how Austria’s scandal ridden Federal Agency for State Protection and Counterterrorism (BVT) had been excluded from European intelligence sharing for a while because it was considered deeply compromised. Another curio has been Sweden. Neighbouring Denmark identified 15 Russian intelligence officers to throw out. The Swedish Security Service (Säpo) last year informed its foreign ministry that one in three Russian representatives in Sweden was in reality a spy, meaning 11 or 12 Russians working in the 35-strong embassy were spies, yet only three were expelled. Carl Bildt, the former Swedish prime minister, has been one of many to ask what was holding Sweden back. Foreign ministries are reluctant to expel, unless the evidence is overwhelming. Diplomats naturally believe in their profession and so regard experts in situ with first hand contacts as vital to conveying accurate information about their host country back to their capital. They also reduce the risks of misunderstandings. This benign take on the value of diplomacy with Russian is becoming a minority view. Even in neutral Ireland, there has been a change in perspective about the 31 Russian diplomats operating in the country. Some of it goes back to 2015 when the Russian embassy in Dublin received planning permission to put new buildings on its 2 hectare (5 acre) site including a large underground building, labelled on the planning application as for storage and plant use. It took a special meeting of the Irish government in March 2020 to reinterpret what was about to be constructed, and to revoke planning permission. Keir Giles, senior consultant to the Chatham House Russia programme, explained: “Spies do not always operate in the country in which they are based. They once operated from a base in Chamonix, for instance, and there was clear risk Ireland was to be their spying headquarters for its European operations. They may have needed somewhere after so many had been thrown out [of the UK] following Skripal. The problem is Russia deters by operating in an asymmetrical way. You either respond in kind or you back down. We throw out spies and they throw out diplomats.” For instance when eight Russian diplomats attached to Nato headquarters in Brussels were thrown out in October 2021, Russia did not just reciprocate, it shut down its whole Nato mission and shut down the Nato information office in Moscow. Meetings of the Nato-Russia Council, the main consultation body between Moscow and the west, were postponed. Now with every day the estrangement seems to grow more profound. Visa requirements become tougher. More than 600 of 800 surveyed western companies have announced they are curtailing activities in Russia beyond what is required by international sanctions, according to a survey by Yale Management. Free media is disappearing, and VPN sites blocked, forcing the west and Russia deeper into their separate information bubbles. Germany will eventually wean itself off Russian energy permanently, curtailing a whole network of business, institutional and cultural links that have developed since the 1970s. Few think that it is a decoupling that can be reversed for decades to come.",,,,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6aec4e906d7c89a6dbc4ff31ea31e54a0e3a0194/0_5_1490_894/master/1490.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=0c5d9c8d4794167525488b554fbbc150

Lawyers may differ, but he’s probably right. So will the US intervene to stop it? Sadly, no. Kyiv badly needs fighter jets and, for example, M1 Abrams main battle tanks to halt the atrocities. Will it get them? No, again. What Ukraine gets far too much of is gesture politics. If and when all its people are dead or uprooted, Biden can say: “I told you so.” This will be no great consolation. The gulf between what western leaders provide and what Ukraine actually requires to survive grows potentially fatal as a huge Russian offensive looms in the east. Russia’s defeat around Kyiv was epic. So, too, is the sinking of the Moskva battle cruiser. But such victories may create a misleading impression about the overall direction of the war.  Even Russian generals, if they stay alive, learn from their mistakes. Ukraine’s darkest hour may just be beginning. Western democracies, grouped around Nato, have done a great deal to help, but not nearly enough. The problem starts with the US, the alliance leader, and it’s a familiar one. Polls suggest most Americans support Ukraine but don’t want US forces directly involved. That’s Biden’s personal instinct, too. A war in Europe looks very different when viewed from Paris, Texas than from Paris, France. It lacks that certain existential edge. Direct, limited Nato military intervention on the ground to create safe havens in western Ukraine, for example, or to target in-theatre artillery, naval and missile forces that bomb civilians, is entirely feasible. The mere threat might give Russia pause. Yet Biden will not hear of it. His fear that it would automatically escalate into all-out Nato-Russia warfare is almost certainly unfounded. Putin knows he would lose such a fight. But who dares put it to the test? That leaves two options: arms and sanctions. But here, too, the west still dithers. When Volodymyr Zelenskiy, Ukraine’s president, appeals, as he does daily, for an immediate embargo on Russian oil, gas and coal exports, he again runs up against a mix of western caution, indecision and self-interest. The EU, for example, is haggling endlessly over a possible oil ban. Yet without such measures, Ukraine’s life chances will greatly diminish over time. The US, like Britain, is expanding the range and quality of the “defensive” weaponry it supplies. Biden’s latest $800m package includes helicopters, armoured personnel carriers, radars and drones. The Pentagon has asked the US military’s eight largest defence contractors to help find ways to arm Ukraine faster and better. This, incidentally, represents a de facto western escalation to which Putin has now formally objected. All western governments will ultimately be to blame if Ukraine falls or is partitioned east from west, like Germany in 1945 Perhaps Russian use of chemical or biological weapons will be the step that triggers a war-changing US response. Majorities of Americans say they would back military action if such illegal weapons are used or if a Nato ally is attacked. The White House, which says it is readying “proportional” non-military retaliatory options, evidently lags behind public opinion. All western governments will ultimately be to blame if Ukraine falls or is partitioned east from west, like Germany in 1945. Britain’s Boris Johnson has accumulated much kudos as Zelenskiy’s self-appointed new best friend. Yet while the UK has provided seriously effective anti-tank weapons, it dutifully toes Washington’s line on planes, tanks and ground troops. Johnson, hamming it up as the British lion in Kyiv last weekend, claimed “Putin’s monstrous aims are being thwarted … We are convening a global alliance to bring this tragedy to an end.” This is plainly untrue. Half the world, including China and India, is unsupportive. And the end is not nearly in sight – which an honest man would admit. Each day more crimes are committed. And the loathsome Putin waxes cocky about his “noble” war. Germany, Europe’s supposed leader, is another sorry case. Chancellor Olaf Scholz says those who perpetrated atrocities in the town of Bucha “must be held accountable”. But that day of reckoning remains a distant dream as long as Scholz continues to reject national and EU-wide energy sanctions and argue over arms supplies. “I don’t understand how anyone in Germany can sleep at night,” said Andriy Melnyk, Ukraine’s ambassador to Berlin. “What does it take for Germany to act?” The crisis has shed uncomfortable light on lucrative links between German big business and Putin’s Kremlin kleptocracy. Bilateral trade totalled €60bn (£50bn) last year. Now the ruling coalition is divided over how far Zeitenwende – Scholz’s term for the historic watershed facing Germany – should go. While a whacking €100bn defence spending increase is promised to protect Germans, Scholz is delaying delivery of a few heavy weapons to protect Ukrainians. The smaller the European nation, the bigger its contribution, or so it often seems. Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia have all stepped up boldly, as have Slovakia, the Czech Republic and Poland. They fear they could be next. Now anxious Finland and Sweden are aiming to join Nato. Having managed without its help throughout the first cold war, they’re just in time for the second. Ukraine’s forces will doubtless fight valiantly in the coming battle for the east. But by some estimates they will be outnumbered five to one. Casualties will inevitably be high, while perhaps the best outcome they can hope for is stalemate. And yet, as this horror unfolds, US-led Nato, the world’s most powerful military alliance, will sit on its hands, apparently prepared, if need be, to watch Ukraine dismembered bit by gruesome bit. Without increased support, Zelenskiy predicts an “endless bloodbath”. Western leaders should talk less and do more – and if all else fails, be ready to intervene militarily.",/p/y98ff,642,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/apr/17/nato-should-talk-less-and-do-more-or-ukraine-will-be-torn-apart-bit-by-bit#comments,

Government whips are trying to decide what Tory MPs should do when the Commons votes tomorrow on a motion calling for a privileges committee inquiry into claims Boris Johnson misled parliament about Partygate. (See 1.07pm.) The government had been expected to order its MPs to vote it down, but Labour - and the six other opposition parties supporting the amendment (see 1.14pm) - have drafted it in such a way as to make it hard for Conservatives to vote against. First, the motion does not explicity accuse Johnson of intentionally misleading MPs. And, second, the motion says the inquiry should not start until the police inquiry into Partygate is over. In another move that should make the motion more acceptable to Tories, Chris Bryant, the Labour chair of the committee, and an outspoken critic of Johnson, has agreed to recuse himself from any inquiry. (See 4.14pm.) Tory MPs are wary of voting down the motion because that would lead to them to being accused by Labour of covering up Johnson’s lying. Government whips also know that, if they order MPs to vote against, many backbenchers might ignore them and abstain - which could see the opposition winning. No 10 is thought to be considering a ploy that would involve Tories voting for an amendment that might water down the potential threat posed by any inquiry, but details are not expected to be announced until later tonight.

Downing Street has gone into open battle with the Church of England over its condemnation of the Rwanda deportation scheme, after No 10 officials doubled down on Boris Johnson’s criticism that archbishops were being unfairly critical.

The move follows pressure from MPs and campaigners concerned that potentially hazardous homes, including care homes and some residential schools, had not been not covered by existing funding.The government is keen not to add more to post-Grenfell costs to be shared by developers, taxpayers and leaseholders that MPs have estimated at £15bn.UK Cladding Action Group said it already knew of at least 10 buildings below 11m where residents have been landed with bills as high as £20,000 each which would not have been covered by the government’s previous plan.Last week Michael Gove, secretary of state for levelling up, housing and communities, announced he had secured £2bn in pledges from 36 developers towards fixing “life critical safety works” in high-rise buildings above 11m in England developed in the last 30 years.Andrew stressed officials believe there was “no systematic risk of fire with buildings below 11m”, but “we will deal with those as a department on a case by case basis”. He pledged: “If the building safety regulator assesses … further work needs to be done we will make sure we do that.”The move to tackle the potential rising cost of the building safety crisis almost five years after the Grenfell Tower fire claimed 72 lives, came as residents of high rise buildings warned they face years of uncertainty despite progress by Gove in persuading developers to pay for some fixes.Leaseholders rallied in Westminster as MPs finalised new building safety laws which look likely to pass within weeks without guaranteeing universal immunity.Campaigners fear the stress on “life critical” works could cause disputes.“Unless there is an independent body to arbitrate we see these issues dragging on for years,” said Rituparna Saha, co-founder of the UK Cladding Action Group. “Even where developers have [already] said they will pay works have not yet started.”This entry has been edited after the government clarified its intentions about buildings under 11m.

He told Gove:The Electoral Commission has now written to you also stating its “firm view” that the strategy and policy statement “is inconsistent with the role that an independent Electoral Commission plays in a healthy democracy”. It would, they argue “provide a mechanism driven by the then governing party enabling that parties ministers to shape how the electoral law is applied to them and their political competitors”. The risk inherent in these provisions is evident for all to see. This is an unacceptable risk to the functioning of our democracy, regardless of the government’s statements regarding their particular approach to the strategy and policy statement. In a report published in December the committee, which has a Conservative majority, said the “strategy and policy statement” proposals in the bill should be dropped. The government has not accepted this recommendation, and in his letter Wragg says, as an alternative, the government should amend the bill to make it clear that the Electoral Commission can ignore the “strategy and policy statement” in certain circumstances. 20 Apr 202216.31Boris Johnson leaving Downing Street this afternoon for the airport, from where he will be flying to India. Photograph: James Manning/PA 20 Apr 202216.14Bryant accepts his past comments about PM lying mean he should not chair possible privileges committee probe into matterChris Bryant, the Labour MP who chairs the Commons privileges committee, has said that if MPs vote for it to carry out an inquiry into whether Boris Johnson misled MPs about Partygate, he will recuse himself as chair for that inquiry. This is because previous statements has had made about Johnson being a liar (like this one) would mean that he would be seen a biased.In an open letter to colleagues, he says that he thinks he would have been able to chair the inquiry fairly, but that it is important it is important for the committee to be seen to proceed “without any imputation of unfairness”.I understand that some honourable and right honourable members have questioned whether I should chair such an inquiry into the prime minister, given that I have made several statements in the media on this matter.
I am certain that if the house were to refer this matter to the committee, all of us would be entirely diligent in setting aside our personal feelings and allegiances, and discharging our duty to protect the reputation of the house without fear or favour.
However, it is also important that the house be seen to proceed fairly without any imputation of unfairness and that the whole house have confidence in the committee of privileges’ proceedings. I have therefore decided that if the motion to refer is carried tomorrow, I will recuse myself from any consideration of the matter.On 1 December @BorisJohnson told the Commons ‘all the guidelines were observed.’ Sue Gray’s ‘update’ may be short on details but she’s already proved he lied. That is and always has been an automatic resignation issue.— Chris Bryant (@RhonddaBryant) January 31, 2022
Bryant also chairs the Commons standards committee (which has the same MPs sitting on it as the privileges committee, but with added lay members). Last year it published a report into allegations that Boris Johnson failed to properly declare who paid for his holiday in Mustique in December 2019. The parliamentary commissioner for standards, Kathryn Stone, said Johnson had broken the MPs’ code of conduct, but the committee came up with a more favourable verdict, clearing the PM of breaking the rules.There are four Conservative MPs on the committee, and three opposition ones (including Bryant). With Bryant recusing himself, Sir Bernard Jenkin (Con) is expected to chair the inquiry if it goes ahead. Bryant says he will continue to chair the committee for other business.Updated at 17.41 BST 20 Apr 202215.27Nicola Sturgeon has said she could step aside as Scotland’s first minister if her party loses another independence referendum.

I’m in the fortunate position of having been in politics for a long time, I’m not about to give it up, but when I do I will hopefully still be relatively young.Alex Salmond, Sturgeon’s predecessor as first minister, resigned after losing the 2014 independence referendum.

Asked if he favoured disbanding Nato, or the UK withdrawing from it, Corbyn replied:I would want to see a world where we start to ultimately disband all military alliances. The issue has to be what’s the best way of bringing about peace in the future? Is it by more alliances? Is it by more military build up?
Or is it by stopping the war in Ukraine and the other wars ...
And ask yourself the question, do military alliances bring peace? Or do they actually encourage each other and build up to a greater danger? I don’t blame Nato for the fact that Russia has invaded Ukraine. What I say is look at the thing historically, and look at the process that could happen at the end of the Ukraine war.Pressed again on whether he favoured disbanding Nato now, Corbyn said: “Look, it’s not going to be disbanded now.” But he repeated his point about military alliances, saying they “tend to build up a mirror image of each other”.Corbyn has had the Labour whip withdrawn, and originally he was told that he would not have it restored, enabling him to stand as a Labour candidate at the next election, until he apologised for suggesting, when the Equality and Human Rights Commission published its report on antisemitism in the Labour party, that the problem had been exaggerated.But in a recent interview with the Guardian Keir Starmer hinted Corbyn’s views on Nato could also prevent him from being readmitted to the parliamentary party. “There is no place in the Labour party for this false equivalence between Russian aggression and Nato,” Starmer said.As Patrick Maguire from the Times reports, in his interview Corbyn also sidestepped a question about whether he admired the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy.More from Jeremy Corbyn's Times Radio interview with @JPonpolitics...On Zelensky pic.twitter.com/M3Gm17RyNk— Patrick Maguire (@patrickkmaguire) April 20, 2022

Photograph: James Manning/PA 20 Apr 202214.44At PMQs Boris Johnson described Keir Starmer as “a Corbynista in a smart Islington suit”. This will come as a surprise to Oliver Eagleton, a New Left Review editor who this month is publishing The Starmer Project: A Journey to the Right. It is not just that Starmer does not even live in Islington. He is from Camden, but Johnson often claims Starmer lives in Islington, assuming that it is a better-known metonym for leftwing privilege. (Johnson should know; he lived in Islington himself for many years.) It is that Starmer is not by any stretch a Corbynista. Eagleton’s book, which includes a particular thorough account of Starmer’s time as director of public prosecutions, argues that the Labour leader’s record “shows his evolution into an unabashed authoritarian”. He concludes: Regardless of whether Labour succeeds at the next election, the overhaul that Starmer instigated in April 2020 looks set to outlast his leadership. Based on the above analysis, it is possible to list the fundamental features of this project: 1) a ‘values-led’, non-antagonistic electoral strategy; 2) an unsparing crackdown on the Labour left, seen as more dangerous than the Conservatives; 3) an Atlanticist authoritarian disposition, combining intervention abroad with repression at home; and 4) a return to neoliberal economic precepts, overseen by Blairite leftovers. These pillars of Starmerism have brought together previously distinct factions of the Labour Right, from social conservatives to liberal globalists.The Starmer Project is the most original and insightful of the (very limited, so far) book-length studies of Starmer. It is also the harshest - although, with Starmer anxious to persuade the public that he has abandoned Corbynism - the broad thrust is not one the Labour leader would query.Updated at 17.42 BST 20 Apr 202214.18At the post-PMQs lobby briefing the prime minister’s press secretary said it was “completely incorrect” to say Boris Johnson had criticised the BBC’s coverage of the Ukraine conflict at his meeting with Tory MPs last night. She said:Broadly, you wouldn’t expect me to comment on reported remarks from a private meeting. But, as the PM just made clear, he did not attack the BBC for their coverage of Ukraine - this is deeply misleading. He has the highest admiration for what journalists are doing - in fact you will have seen him publicly praise their bravery out in Ukraine. 
I think the more general point is there have been examples of coverage that don’t properly differentiate between those [migrants] who are arriving in the UK via safe legal routes and those who are arriving via illegal, dangerous and unnecessary routes. 20 Apr 202214.13Sir Charles Walker, vice-chair of the backbench Conservative 1922 Committee, told the World at One that he planned to abstain in tomorrow’s vote on setting up an inquiry into claims Boris Johnson misled parliament. He explained:As much as I am deeply annoyed at what went on in No 10, I am also not in a position where I have much goodwill towards a Labour party who, in my view, failed to advance any form of arguments or raise any of its own concerns about the consequences of a 20-month lockdown.Walker said he did not think there were enough Conservative MPs calling for a confidence vote in Johnson for one to go ahead. But that could change, he said:If the fines keep racking up, there is only so long that the prime minister will be able to lean on his party for supports. Ultimately it rests on the Sue Gray report and whether or not any more fines are issued.Updated at 14.26 BST 20 Apr 202214.07Sturgeon says her face mask error very different to 'serial culture of law breaking' at No 10Nicola Sturgeon has insisted there is a “very, very clear difference” between her face mask “error” and the apparent “serial culture of lawbreaking” at Downing Street lockdown parties, PA Media reports.In an interview with STV, Sturgeon said:I have recognised I made an error in not having a mask on for literally a few seconds.
I was campaigning in the street, my mask was in my pocket, I got shouted into a barbers, I was talking to people, and for a few seconds I forgot to put my mask back on.
I do think it is important for me to recognise that was wrong, and I shouldn’t, even for those few seconds, have lapsed in that.
People will make up their own minds about that. My view, and what I would say to people, is that I don’t think it is equivalent to what Boris Johnson is accused of, the what appears to be serial culture of law breaking in No 10, but then the misleading of parliament.
I do think there is a very, very clear difference there and I think it is reasonable for me to point that out.Nicola Sturgeon campaigning in Dundee last week. Photograph: Getty ImagesUpdated at 14.27 BST 20 Apr 202213.59Here is my colleague Peter Walker’s story from PMQs.Boris Johnson denies BBC criticism but makes no Welby apologyRead moreAnd this is how it starts.Boris Johnson has vehemently denied criticising the BBC over its coverage of Ukraine, while pointedly failing to deny that he accused the Church of England of being more critical of his Rwanda deportation scheme than towards Russia. 20 Apr 202213.45PMQs - snap verdictIt must be confusing being a Conservative MP at times. Are you supposed to hate the BBC or not? Earlier this year, on day one of what was dubbed “Operation Red Meat”, the No 10 operation to shore up Boris Johnson’s position with a rightwing policy offer for Tory MPs, Nadine Dorries, the culture secretary, said the BBC licence fee was definitely going. A day later she had to soften her position somewhat, after the Treasury insisted the future of the licence fee was just being reviewed. This morning Tory MPs will have read in the Daily Telegraph that Johnson believes the BBC has been soft on Vladimir Putin. At PMQs Johnson insisted that was wrong, and at the end of the session a loyalist backbencher used a point of order to insist that Conservative MPs are in fact great fans of the corporation. (See 12.43pm.)In part, this might be an indication of how the cerebral cortex of the Conservative party has enough nous to realise that the attack lines that play well with the headline writers for rightwing newspapers are not always popular with the public. The BBC has been widely praised for its coverage of the Ukraine war, and there are no votes to be gained in slagging it off on this. But it also seems that Johnson’s views have been misrepresented by his old paper. While Johnson evidently did criticise both the BBC and the Church of England for their negative coverage of the Rwanda policy at this meeting with Tory MPs last night, the more nuanced reporting stressed that his pro-Putin jibe was aimed specifically at the clergy - and in particular the archbishop of Canterbury. (See 9.2oam.)This explains why Johnson was so indignant - and why he came out with a clear denial. Starmer said to him:The prime minister also accused the BBC of not being critical enough of Putin. Would the prime minister have the guts to say that to the face of [BBC reporters] Clive Myrie, Lyse Doucet and Steve Rosenberg, who have all risked their lives day in, day out on the frontline in Russia and Ukraine uncovering Putin’s barbarism?Johnson replied: I said nothing of the kind and I have the highest admiration as a former journalist for what journalists do. I think they do an outstanding job. I think he should withdraw what he just said - it has absolutely no basis or foundation in truth.Some people will have watched and concluded that Johnson was slandered. But - as has sadly been explained here before - the effectiveness of an attack line is not always related to its accuracy, and Starmer probably won this particular exchange on points. (Johnson’s problem is that, even if he did not criticise the BBC in the way it was alleged, it is easy to imagine how he might have done.) Starmer was even more effective with this early Partygate questions, and he did help to establish that, although Johnson may deny accusing the BBC of being pro-Putin, he is not ashamed of saying that about the Church of England. (See 12.09pm.)Johnson seemed to enjoy today’s PMQs more than yesterday’s 100-minute apologising session. His jibe about Starmer being “a Corbynista in a smart Islington suit”, which he repeated, did not really work (because it is obviously not true), but the joke about Starmer being stuck in a “Dr Who timewarp” was good. And there will be viewers who will have agreed with his overall argument, that it is time to move on from Partygate. But it is a Tory argument with minority, partisan appeal. If polling is a reliable guide, there are more people for whom this won’t wash.Updated at 13.50 BST 20 Apr 202213.16Starmer urges Tory MPs to vote for inquiry into PM misleading Commons 'to restore decency, honesty and integrity' in politicsAnd this is what Keir Starmer said in a statement about the Labour motion.We are urging Conservative MPs to do the right thing. To respect the sacrifice that their constituents made during the pandemic. To say that the public were right to follow the rules. And to vote in the national interest not under pressure from the party whips. 
The British public know that the rules were broken in Downing Street. Voting to say otherwise won’t persuade the public that everything was fine but will further damage the reputation of any Conservative MP who is happy to say it was one rule for the public and another for this government.

Labour has has headed this off by incorporating a delay into its own motion.Significantly, the motion also says the inquiry should cover claims that Johnson misled the Commons. It does not explicitly accuse Johnson of deliberately misleading the Commons - a much more serious offence that amounts to an resignation offence under the ministerial code.

Berlin has not ruled out shipping tanks to Ukraine, “even if it may sound like that in the German debate”, said Annalena Baerbock at a joint press conference in Riga with the Latvian foreign minister, Edgars Rinkēvičs.  However, as the German army has run out of military hardware it can dispatch swiftly without undermining its own security commitments, the Green politician said her government had agreed instead a swap system whereby it would help refill the gaps in the arsenal of Nato and G7 states that are in a position to help Ukraine more quickly. “We support partners that can deliver weapons quickly and guarantee replacements,” said Baerbock at the start of her three-day tour of the Baltic states. Ukrainian commander in Mariupol says forces ‘facing last days, if not hours’Read more At a press conference on Tuesday evening, the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, confirmed that his government was planning to support Kyiv with cash rather than by sending tanks or armoured vehicles from its own stocks. “We have asked the German arms industry to tell us which material it can deliver in the short term,” Scholz said. “Ukraine has now made a selection from this list and we will provide it with the required money for the purchase.” The list of materials included anti-tank weapons, anti-airplane systems and munition “that could be used in artillery battle”, he said. The Ukrainian government has complained that Scholz’s list does not include the kind of heavy weapons that would allow its forces to mount a counter-offensive against Russian troops in the Donbas region, such as the Panzerhaubitze 2000 artillery system. Ukraine’s ambassador in Berlin, Andrij Melnyk, said on Tuesday night that Scholz’s lack of direct material support had been received in Kyiv “with great disappointment and bitterness”. Donbas region After Russia’s invasion of its easterly neighbour on 27 February, Scholz announced an “epochal change” in Germany’s stance on weapons exports and military spending. But critics in Europe and at home say the Social Democrat chancellor has failed to follow up on his grand announcements with the firm steps required to send a message to the Kremlin and to reassure Nato allies that Germany has departed from its policy of rapprochement. Berlin has already blocked European requests for an immediate embargo on Russian energy imports, saying it would not be able to wean itself off Russian oil until the end of the year and Russian gas until mid-2024 without destabilising its economy. 01:08Ukrainian commander says forces in Mariupol facing 'last days' – video Tuesday’s speech seemed designed to assure a domestic audience that Germany’s three-party coalition government was acting in unison with its western partners. “Germany going alone would be wrong,” Scholz said. “Those who are in a comparable situation to us are acting the same.” However, this week several other Nato states communicated in clearer terms than Germany that they are willing to send heavy weapons to Ukraine. The Dutch prime minister, Mark Rutte, announced on Tuesday that the Netherlands would ship heavy equipment, including armoured vehicles, while a US Pentagon official said on Monday that the first parts of its $800m (£613m) tranche of helicopters, howitzers and Humvees had already arrived on Ukrainian soil. Baerbock said on Wednesday that Germany had in the past chosen not to make public all the weapons it has sent to support Ukraine, adding that the government could help Kyiv maintain more advanced weapons systems and train soldiers to use them. “We have delivered anti-tank missiles, Stingers and other things that we have never spoken about publicly, so these deliveries could happen quickly,” she said. Germany was in a better position to support Ukraine’s defensive effort in the long run rather than the short term, Baerbock said. “It is about the next three months, and the next three years. This is where Germany can contribute more.”",,,,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2fa43e5d46d913562bb97d7b92edb5143163dfbb/520_759_3911_2347/master/3911.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=0582d838f752dd4f86f8592eea1307de

Pekka Haavisto is having a busy few weeks. As Finland’s foreign minister, Haavisto, 64, may soon oversee the biggest political shift the country has experienced since it joined the EU almost three decades ago. “Finland is currently making its choices. And among those choices, Nato membership is one,” Haavisto told the Guardian in an interview on Thursday.  ‘There will be no way back’: will war change Finland’s pragmatic approach to Russia?Read more Yesterday, the Finnish parliament started its much-anticipated debate over the possibility of submitting a membership bid to Nato. Recent polls have shown a dramatic U-turn in public opinion in Finland, with the majority now favouring joining Nato after the invasion of Ukraine. “Our security environment has dramatically changed after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine on 24 February,” the veteran Green party politician said. Haavisto proceeded to list the conclusions Finland has drawn about its big neighbour that have led to the political debates in his country. Moscow has shown its willingness to take increasing risks in its military operations and demonstrated its ability to quickly mobilise more than 100,000 soldiers against a neighbouring country without conducting a general mobilisation. “Russia’s behaviour is more unpredictable, and it is ready to take higher risks than earlier. If we look at Georgia in 2008 or Crimea in 2014, we could say that in those cases, Russia took calculated risks,” the minister said, referring to the war in Georgia and the annexation of Crimea. “What is different now is that we see that Russia’s original purpose when attacking Ukraine was to change the regime in a country of 40 million people. This is a high-risk operation for Russia, but Russia showed it was ready to take those risks.” Haavisto said he was also deeply troubled by reports that Russia could use nuclear weapons in Ukraine as its military continues to struggle. “For Russia’s neighbours, the country’s loose talk on the use of unconventional weapons, including tactical nuclear weapons and chemicals, is very uncomfortable. “This is a really concerning issue for us. This has triggered talk in Finland about our own security position in Europe.” Sweden and Finland are deliberating Nato membership Western intelligence officials have started to publicly warn that the Kremlin might turn to tactical or other limited nuclear weapons from its arsenal if its invasion of Ukraine continues to flounder. On Wednesday, Bloomberg reported that these fears were also shared by some senior Russian officials and senior managers of state-run businesses. Russia, which has previously denied planning a military operation against Ukraine, has stated its commitment to avoiding nuclear war. However, on Wednesday, Moscow test-launched its Sarmat intercontinental ballistic missile, a new addition to its nuclear arsenal, which President Vladimir Putin said would give Moscow’s enemies “something to think about”. Haavisto said that, for the first time in his long political career, Finns “on the streets” are concerned with the “nuclear” question. “A typical question that I now get from people on the streets or in the shops, which I did not have during my whole political life, is what Finland will do if it is threatened by nuclear or chemical weapons. As a politician, you have to have an answer for that,” he said. That Finland, a country that traditionally maintained dialogue with the Kremlin, is openly raising the possibility of Russia using nuclear weapons indicates just how much of a threat the west perceives the country to be after its invasion of Ukraine. Russia warns of nuclear weapons in Baltic if Sweden and Finland join NatoRead more The popular president of the Nordic state, Sauli Niinistö – often described as the “Putin whisperer” due to his direct line to the Kremlin – had been engaged in long conversations trying to persuade the Russian president not to invade Ukraine. Haavisto now shrugged that it was “a big disappointment that Russia chose the military way in Ukraine” despite the Finnish efforts. The minister said Finland has kept its diplomatic channels open with Russia during the war, and he pointed to Niinistö’s call with Putin on 10 March as one of the ways his country was trying to get Putin to the negotiating table. Finland is expected to make a decision on whether to apply for Nato membership within the next few weeks, and it will take between four and 12 months for the 30 members of the alliance to formally accept the country. “In that period, we are prepared for all kinds of [Russian] disturbances, cyber-attacks, hybrid attacks and so forth. It is just something you have to be prepared for,” Haavisto said. On Wednesday, much discussion in the Helsinki parliament centred around the changes the country will see if it becomes part of the defensive bloc, given Finland’s 830-mile shared border with Russia. “I think Nato’s basic idea is this common and shared security that gets activated in a time of crisis, in a time of conflict you get help from the other members,” said Haavisto, adding that Finland intends to maintain conscription and its reserve of 280,000 soldiers. “But in the time of peace, I cannot see a major change in our defence … Russia is and will always be our neighbour. We have always appreciated a peaceful border, we would like to keep it that way.”",,,,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0f8fbed116c947e26db8dae25bb49ad0c4d776e7/0_72_5891_3534/master/5891.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=07842ad4b6661dca1137aa2f73a0f8d8

Yet the scenic views are deceiving – for the city’s 70,000 inhabitants, the mood has suddenly soured. “I have always felt very safe growing up here, but since the war that has somewhat changed,” said Noora Ikonen, a local barista. “I catch myself feeling anxious.”  The war she refers to is being fought nearly 1,000 miles away in Ukraine. But Finland shares an 830-mile land border with Russia and Lappeenranta is only 19 miles from the frontier – closer to Russian president Vladimir Putin’s home city of St Petersburg than to the Finnish capital, Helsinki. “Naturally, locals here are concerned and worried. We were all shocked when Russia invaded Ukraine. We were used to working and living alongside Russians,” the city’s longtime mayor, Kimmo Jarva, said on Wednesday from his office overlooking the frozen bay on the Saimaa lake. After the Soviet Union’s fall, Lappeenranta epitomised Finland’s pragmatic relationship with Russia, which centred around developing business relations with Moscow while successive Finnish leaders maintained dialogue with Putin. Jarva estimated that 1.5 million Russians visited the city every year pre-pandemic, bringing in millions of euros in revenue, with some shops specifically catering to them. Lappeenranta also established its own office in St Petersburg and marketed itself to tourists in the west as a “gateway” to Russia. “We were always open to working with Russians. But everything changed after the war,” Jarva said. Very few cars now embark on the highway leading to the Finnish-Russian border as the two countries have practically banned all private and commercial traffic from entering each other’s territories. After the Soviet Union’s fall, Lappeenranta epitomised Finland’s pragmatic relationship with Russia, which centred around developing business relations. Photograph: Zoonar GmbH/Alamy “This city has now chosen a different path. There will be no way back,” Jarva said. That path might soon lead to Finland, and neighbouring Sweden, joining the Nato military alliance, in what would be a historic policy shift for the two northern European states. The decision is considered critical, especially as Ukraine’s possible future membership of Nato was used as a key reason by Moscow for the invasion. On Wednesday, Finland’s parliament started discussing a government report outlining the implications and risks of Nato membership, marking the symbolic beginning of the official debate on a potential application to join the defensive block. Officials have already indicated that they do not expect a lengthy debate, with the Finnish prime minister, Sanna Marin, saying last week that her country would decide whether to apply “quite fast, in weeks not months”. Ikonen, the barista, said that she fully backed joining Nato, and her sentiment is echoed by others on the city’s streets. Just five years ago, Ikonen’s support would have placed her among the minority in Finland, with polls showing that only 21% of the population backed joining the alliance, a figure that did not fluctuate much for decades. However, the invasion of Ukraine has led to a tectonic shift in public opinion towards the bloc that could result in Nato forces being stationed on Russia’s extensive north-western border. “Finland decided it wanted to join Nato on 24 February at 5am when Russian forces went into Ukraine,” former Finnish prime minister Alexander Stubb said. Russia warns of nuclear weapons in Baltic if Sweden and Finland join NatoRead more In polls taken after the invasion, roughly 60% of Finns said they would favour applying to join Nato, a figure Stubb expects to only grow in the coming weeks. “If Russia is ready to slaughter their Slavic brothers in Ukraine, why would it not do the same thing with Finland? Many Finns woke up and said: ‘Enough! Now it is time to join Nato,’” Stubb added. Himself a longtime Nato advocate, Stubb argued it was only natural that Finns had changed their stance in response to Russia’s actions. “Finns are very rational, pragmatic people. They adjust their opinion as the circumstances change. Now people have realised Russia is an unpredictable and isolated aggressor.” The speed with which views have changed has, however, surprised even those watching Finnish politics closely. “No one I know can think of anything remotely similar in Finnish history where public opinion has changed so quickly, so radically,” said Charly Salonius-Pasternak, a security expert at the Finnish Institute of International Affairs. “We thought it would be the political elites that would push for Nato, but it is the opposite. The Finns themselves have chosen this path,” he said. Experts argue that Finland’s current sentiments are rooted in its own war with Moscow, which has echoes of the invasion of Ukraine. In 1939-40, the gruelling Winter War resulted in Finland conceding a large part of its territory to the Soviet Union, including the city of Vyborg, only a 30-minute train ride from Lappeenranta. “The solidarity with Ukraine is huge. We are seeing a lot of comparison between Ukraine and the Winter War in the media, in public debates,” said Arkady Moshes of the Finnish Institute of International Affairs. According to Moshes, many Finns “instinctively turn to stories” of the Winter War when they see Ukraine fighting a bigger, more powerful neighbour on their own. “Finns aren’t very open about their emotions, but what is happening in Ukraine has brought up sentiments that seemed to have been kept inside for decades,” Moshes said. A recent poll showed that 84% of Finns now believe that Russia poses a significant military threat. “My generation didn’t experience any wars, but my parents and grandparents were forced to flee to the west of the country during the war with the Soviets,” said Heli Pukki, the owner of an art shop in Lappeenranta. ‘This is the first time in my life that I started thinking about my safety’. Heli Pukki in Lappeenranta. Photograph: Pjotr Sauer/The Guardian “But we were brought up with their experiences, we carried them in our hearts.” Pukki said she did not feel any hate toward Russians and would always “happily welcome” them in her shop, but the war in Ukraine changed something overnight. “This is the first time in my life that I started thinking about my safety, about my peaceful life here. We always knew that we had this big country on our border, but now it feels like something is really boiling there, the country not moving in the right direction. No one knows what will happen next,” she said. Russia has warned Finland and Sweden against joining Nato, saying the move would destabilise Europe. Last week, former Russian president Dmitry Medvedev issued the country’s strongest threat yet, warning that Russia would have to strengthen its land, naval and air forces in the Baltic Sea if Finland and Sweden join Nato. Medvedev also raised the nuclear threat by warning that there could be no more talk of a “nuclear-free” Baltic – where Russia has its Kaliningrad exclave between Poland and Lithuania. But while locals expressed some concern about possible Russian reactions to the country’s plans to join Nato, Finnish experts and officials have urged calm, saying their country is prepared for any aggression. “The nuclear threat is nothing new,” said Stubb, pointing to reports that Russia is already keeping nuclear weapons in Kaliningrad. “We expect more Russian cyber-attacks and airspace violations. But we have been preparing for this for a long time,” he said. Stubb and other analysts dismissed the possibility that Russia would be able to threaten Finland militarily in the near future. “Russia can’t fight on two fronts, and they would be facing one of the most sophisticated militaries in the world. As always, we remain calm, cool and collected. We know what we are doing,” the former prime minister said. Finland has maintained strong defence spending over the last 30 years while the rest of Europe has largely made cuts. The Nordic state is also one of the few European countries to have retained military conscription, and almost a third of its adult population are reservists. Lappeenranta’s mayor, Jarva, similarly said he did not expect any military threats coming out of Moscow, adding the border has “never been quieter”. Nevertheless, he said his city had thoroughly checked all its bomb shelters shortly after the start of Russia’s invasion. “This is what we always do, we stay prepared. The war just makes us a bit more motivated to do so.”",,,,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a58f6a34379646e3dc941523afaf303429c3df2c/0_605_4032_2419/master/4032.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=10f20ddf7c96942bff7c5a8cbe5d5d21

The result would be catastrophe,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/24/the-awful-truth-is-dawning-putin-may-win-in-ukraine-the-result-would-be-catastrophe,"The contrast was startling. In New York, António Guterres, the UN secretary general, launched a belated, desperately needed initiative to halt the war in Ukraine. “At this time of great peril and consequence, he [Guterres] would like to discuss urgent steps to bring about peace,” his spokesman said. The UN chief, he revealed, was proposing immediate, in-person talks with Vladimir Putin in Moscow and Volodymyr Zelenskiy in Kyiv. At roughly the same time as this hopeful development unfolded, the UK’s Boris Johnson, riding a “Partygate” getaway plane to India, was colourfully rubbishing peace efforts. Putin, he claimed, was an untrustworthy reptile. “I really don’t see how the Ukrainians can easily sit down and come to some kind of accommodation. How can you negotiate with a crocodile when it’s got your leg in its jaws?” Johnson asked.  This gaping disconnect is doubly disturbing. It suggests lack of coordination between the UN chief and a permanent member of the UN security council on how best to proceed. It also highlights a wider problem: diverging, sometimes opposing, occasionally self-serving, approaches to the crisis by western leaders who have hitherto trumpeted their unity of purpose. The outrage in western countries sparked by Putin’s 24 February invasion is starting to fade. Likewise the burst of optimism that followed Ukraine’s success in repelling the Russian advance around Kyiv. Now, as Moscow begins a huge, slow-motion offensive in the east, concern grows that this conflict has no end-point and that the enormous economic and human damage that results may be permanent – and global. Johnson supports a free, independent Ukraine but, like other alliance leaders, appears to lack a thought-through, long-term plan to achieve it Johnson, typically, is not looking much beyond the present moment. The UK and Nato, he said, would just “keep going with the strategy” of imposing sanctions on Russia and supplying weapons to Kyiv. Johnson supports a free, independent Ukraine but, like other alliance leaders, appears to lack a thought-through, long-term plan to achieve it. What if Ukrainian forces start losing? What if the country is partitioned, or nears collapse? The price of failure – the true cost of a Putin victory – could be staggering. It is potentially unsupportable for fractious western democracies and poorer countries alike, beset by simultaneous post-pandemic security, energy, food, inflation and climate crises. Yet out of myopic self-interest over issues such as Russian oil and gas imports, and from fear of wider escalation, western leaders duck the tough choices that could ensure Ukraine’s survival and help mitigate such ills. The past week furnished a grim glimpse of the future that awaits if Putin is able to continue to wage war with impunity, commit more heinous crimes, threaten nuclear and chemical blackmail and trash the UN charter. Drastically downgrading its growth forecasts due to the conflict, the International Monetary Fund predicted global economic fragmentation, rising debt and social unrest. David Malpass, head of the World Bank, said a “human catastrophe” loomed as an unprecedented, estimated 37% rise in food prices, caused by war-related disruption to supplies, pushed millions into poverty, increased malnutrition, and reduced funding for education and healthcare for the least well-off. More than 5 million people have fled Ukraine in two months, and more will follow, exacerbating an international migration emergency that extends from Afghanistan to the Sahel. In drought-hit east Africa, the World Food Programme says 20 million people may face starvation this year. Putin’s war did not create the drought, but the UN warns it could hurt efforts to reduce global heating, thereby triggering further displacement and forced migration. The broader, negative political impact of the war, should it rage on indefinitely, is almost incalculable. The UN’s future as an authoritative global forum, lawmaker and peacekeeper is in jeopardy, as more than 200 former officials warned Guterres last week. At risk, too, is the credibility of the international court of justice, whose injunction to withdraw was scorned by Putin, and the entire system of war crimes prosecutions. In terms of democratic norms and human rights, the full or partial subjugation of Ukraine would spell disaster for the international rules-based order – and a triumph for autocrats everywhere. What message would it send, for example, to China over Taiwan, or indeed to Putin as he covets the vulnerable Baltic republics? Islamist terrorists who now furtively plot to exploit the west’s Ukraine distraction would relish such a victory for violence. Failure to stop the war, rescue Ukraine and punish Russia’s rogue regime to the fullest extent possible would come at an especially high price for Europe and the EU. In prospect is a second cold war with permanent Nato bases on Russia’s borders, massively increased defence spending, an accelerating nuclear arms race, unceasing cyber and information warfare, endemic energy shortages, rocketing living costs, and more French-style, Russian-backed rightwing populist extremism. In short, the dawn of a new age of instability. Why on earth would politicians such as America’s Joe Biden, Germany’s Olaf Scholz, and France’s Emmanuel Macron tolerate so fraught and dangerous a future when, by taking a more robust stand now, they might prevent much of it from materialising? By supposedly avoiding risks today, they ensure a much riskier tomorrow. Sending weapons and best wishes is not enough. Conferring last week, western leaders debated providing security guarantees for Ukraine after the war. All well and good. But this war is happening now. Who will guarantee Ukraine’s survival in the possibly decisive next few weeks? Who, if push comes to shove, will move beyond training missions and provide direct, in-country military support? Let’s get real. For all its heroism and sacrifice, Ukraine may lose this fight. Dreadful though it sounds, Putin could win. If the west so abandons its principles and values to let that happen, the long-term price, for everyone, will be a whole new world of pain.",,,,

The Swedish newspaper Expressen cited government sources as confirming the report. The two countries’ prime ministers said this month they were deliberating the question, arguing Russia’s invasion of Ukraine had changed Europe’s “whole security landscape” and “dramatically shaped mindsets” in the Nordic region. Finland’s prime minister, Sanna Marin, said then that her country, which shares a 1,300km (810 mile) border with Russia, would decide whether to apply to join the alliance “quite fast, in weeks not months”, despite the risk of infuriating Moscow. Her Swedish counterpart, Magdalena Andersson, said Sweden had to be “prepared for all kinds of actions from Russia” and that “everything had changed” when Moscow attacked Ukraine. Russia has repeatedly warned both countries against the move. The Kremlin said it would be forced to “restore military balance” by strengthening its defences in the Baltic, including by deploying nuclear weapons, if the two countries decided to abandon decades of military nonalignment by joining Nato.

The Guardian could not independently confirm the reports.

Polling in Sweden suggests a slim majority of Swedes also back membership.

But how much more will Nato commit to Ukraine?,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/27/western-war-aims-are-growing-but-how-much-more-will-nato-commit-to-ukraine,"Step by step, the west’s war aims are expanding. What began as an effort to supply “defensive weapons” to Ukraine has evolved into an attempt to provide heavier weaponry. This week Germany and the UK agreed to supply armoured anti-aircraft artillery vehicles to keep Russia’s air force at bay. On Monday Lloyd Austin, the US defence secretary, said the west’s goal was to “weaken Russia” to the point where it could no longer invade or threaten its neighbours.  A day later the British junior defence minister James Heappey said it would be “completely legitimate” for Ukraine to use western weapons to strike inside Russia if need be. Russia-Ukraine war: Putin warns of ‘lightning fast’ retaliation if west intervenes; Mariupol commander makes urgent plea – live Read more These are different, more specific, statements, compared with some of the broad-brush rhetoric used in the early phase of the war when Russian forces were menacing Kyiv, and Ukraine’s crisis seemed existential. “Vladimir Putin’s act of aggression must fail and be seen to fail,” Boris Johnson wrote in March. It was a generalised observation by the British prime minister that tactfully avoided spelling out any specific outcome. Yet the language has toughened as the conflict has stalled. On the ground Russia’s well-telegraphed assault on the Donbas is still only gradually unfolding, with the gain of a handful of villages near Izyum, where the attempt to envelop Ukraine’s forces continues without any sign of a breakthrough, hindered by rainy weather, strong resistance and command and control problems. Ukraine conflict map On the other hand, there is no sign yet that Kyiv’s forces can counterattack in the strength required to force Russia back in the Donbas or the south, where Russia said on Tuesday it had captured the entire Kherson region. Meanwhile, the Kremlin has seized on the slowly enhanced weapon supply to sound off. On Monday, Sergei Lavrov, Russia’s foreign minister, said that Nato was “in essence … engaged in a war with Russia through a proxy and is arming that proxy” in an interview where he also warned of the risks of a third world war and even nuclear conflict. Nato is not at war with Russia, but it is hard not to conclude that the west is engaged in a proxy fight because of the ongoing arms supply. Nevertheless, western officials reject Lavrov’s proxy war description, because they do not want to lend legitimacy to any Russian reprisals beyond Ukraine’s territory. “There is a Russian narrative that this is a proxy war between Russia and Nato. It isn’t. We are supporting Ukraine in their self-defence,” said one official on Wednesday, partly in an attempt to clarify Heappey’s remarks about using western weapons in Russia itself. 01:10Putin warns of ‘lightning fast’ retaliation against interference in Ukraine – video But given how much Russia is struggling militarily in Ukraine, the idea that Moscow could open a new front by, as Lavrov suggested, striking against weapons delivery in Nato countries, seems unlikely – not least because it would invite a western military response. Nuclear threats are also designed to intimidate, but there remains an irreducible risk that Putin would escalate further if he felt threatened. What is less certain is what the end state of the fighting will be. On Tuesday, Nikolai Patrushev, the powerful head of Russia’s security council, said “the result of the policy of the west and the Kyiv regime under its control can only be the disintegration of Ukraine into several states” in a Russian newspaper interview – arguably seeking to justify a de facto division of Ukraine along military frontlines. On Wednesday, western officials said they would like to see Ukraine restored to the boundaries existing before 24 February – the start of the Russian invasion – “as a minimum”. However, Ukraine is nowhere near being able to achieve such goals on the battlefield. A crucial period will come in the next month or so as the latest wave of western weapons, including US howitzers and German and British anti-aircraft systems, arrives. If that does not prove enough to change the military balance, the question will become how much more Britain and other Nato members are prepared to commit.",,,,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b58340f439c7cb2fe658d66e6dd1d595d4796c49/56_182_5760_3455/master/5760.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=8e6a1f7c6510c85cac25a8d2af2165e5

Russia’s state energy company Gazprom halted gas supplies to two EU member states – Poland and Bulgaria – on Wednesday and warned that more countries could be similarly targeted. Poland, with good reason, described this as a “direct attack”. Moscow is also talking darkly of delivering a “proportionate response” to the demonisation of Russia by western governments. On Tuesday, Mr Putin’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, accused Nato of “engaging in a war with Russia through a proxy”. The risk of nuclear escalation, he said, was becoming “considerable”. Economic warfare and apocalyptic threats can be read as signs of Russia’s bitter frustration at the way events have unfolded since February. The scale and practical value of western solidarity with Ukraine – in the form of sanctions, financial aid and military assistance – have come as an unpleasant surprise to the Kremlin. The humiliating failure of Mr Putin’s initial plan to capture Kyiv and topple the Ukrainian government was down to the bravery and skill of those who fought to defend their country. But external military assistance was crucial in giving the country’s armed forces sufficient means to resist.  As the focus of the Kremlin’s campaign shifts to the eastern Donbas region and southern Ukraine, that support is continuing and adapting to the likely circumstances of a more attritional phase of the war. The US has announced a £600m package of military and financial aid that will include more advanced western weapons as well as non-Nato ammunition for Soviet-made tanks and artillery. Britain has indicated that it may send howitzers and anti-aircraft systems. Despite a previous reluctance to directly supply heavy weaponry, Chancellor Olaf Scholz has now approved the delivery of German tanks to Ukraine, though it is unclear how soon they will be usable. Helping Ukraine defend itself is the right thing to do. But as the foreign secretary, Liz Truss, calls for western powers to escalate intervention still further and provide fighter jets to Ukraine, Mr Scholz’s initial reservations are worth recalling. In an interview with Der Spiegel, he argued that “everything must be done to avoid a direct military confrontation between Nato and a highly armed superpower like Russia”. So far, the west has managed to balance caution and assistance to good effect, emphasising the defensive nature of the support it has offered Kyiv. But there are some signs, rhetorically at least, of needless escalation. In a press conference earlier this week, the US defence secretary, Lloyd Austin, appeared to expand Washington’s objectives beyond the defence of Ukraine to weakening Russia’s capacity for future aggression and strengthening Nato. Already implicit in America’s actions, this would have been best left unsaid. Equally, to “double down” in the way Ms Truss proposes would ratchet up the risks in a context that is becoming more, not less, volatile – as recent explosions in Transnistria, a pro-Russian separatist region of Moldova, testify. If the UK goes down this path, it should only be after the fullest consultation with parliament and an honest public debate about the dilemmas and uncertainties involved. Russia’s nuclear threats are a sign of the Kremlin’s desperation, but they also illustrate the frighteningly high stakes in the most serious conflict on European soil since the second world war.",/p/ybb7p,294.0,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/apr/27/the-guardian-view-on-war-in-ukraine-the-stakes-rise-higher#comments,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a3fc682e4e4915060a0d6517d534aad36d335140/0_0_3671_2202/master/3671.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=866cf9b68468f684c395e586f17eb16c

Gen Waldemar Skrzypczak, also a former junior defence minister, complained that a loose-lipped prime minister had revealed too much to the Russians and that his remarks risked the safety of the soldiers involved.  Speaking to Polish tabloid Fakt, Skrzypczak said that Johnson had revealed “a military secret” and that “bad words are on the lips” when he gave details of the Ukrainian training plan on a trip to India last week. “Military training is a matter of the army, in such a situation secret. Let a man restrain himself and think before he says such things,” said the former general to the newspaper, which described his tone as irritated in an article from Friday. “The prime minister may not be aware of it, but with such statements he puts the success of the entire military operation at risk, as well as the safety of the soldiers,” Skrzypczak said. “Such statements are tempting evil.” On the visit, Johnson had revealed that Ukrainians were being taught how to use Nato-standard weapons in both Poland and the UK. “I can say that we are currently training Ukrainians in Poland in the use of anti-aircraft defence, and actually in the UK in the use of armoured vehicles,” he said. British forces in Poland are training the Ukrainian military in using the Starstreak air defence missile systems. It is likely to be a few weeks before they can be deployed on the frontline to target Russian helicopters and aircraft. Russia has become irritated by the west’s increased supply of weapons to Ukraine, after its unprovoked invasion of the country two months ago. Earlier this week, Sergei Lavrov, Russian’s foreign minister, accused Nato of being “engaged in a war with Russia through a proxy and is arming that proxy”. Lavrov added that weapons supplied by western countries “will be a legitimate target” and that Russian forces had already hit weapons warehouses in western Ukraine. But, despite the threats, it is not thought likely that Russia would seek to target them within Nato countries for fear of retaliation.

A western official said on Wednesday: “There is a Russian narrative that this is a proxy war between Russia and Nato. It isn’t.” He added: “We are entitled to provide military support to any state exercising its right to self-defence.” Skrzypczak said he was concerned about how much detail Johnson had been prepared to go into. “It is hard to imagine that when we were on missions abroad, one of the politicians would talk about our plans or training on television.”",,,,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/740ddef58954a97c3fbe5919e5502566a636addb/0_70_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=2a3b3b535ec36e407cb1ebc7086a4098

The west must act to end this war now,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/apr/27/ukraine-war-end-putin-russia-talks,"Few people in the west doubt that Ukraine is fighting a just war. Russia’s invasion was entirely unprovoked. Whatever complaints it may have had about Nato expansion or Ukraine’s mistreatment of Russians in Donbas, nobody had attacked Russia, and nobody was planning to. Vladimir Putin launched a straightforward war of aggression and territorial conquest. It follows that supporting Ukraine is the right thing to do. But it is not at all clear that the kind of support we are giving (and not giving) is the right way to go about preserving the Ukrainian nation.  The longer this war rages on, the more Ukrainians will flee their homeland, and the more devastation will be wrought upon their homes, cities, industry and economy. Yet the west’s current approach of supporting Ukraine’s war aim of defeating the aggressor, and providing arms for that purpose while pointedly avoiding direct military intervention, is guaranteed to prolong the war. Russia’s progress may be slowed, but it’s highly unlikely to be stopped, far less pushed out of Ukraine, and in the meantime the grinding destruction and hideous war crimes will continue. No day goes past without some senior western politician proclaiming that Ukraine will be “successful” and that Russia is “failing”. This is certainly morale-boosting. But it is clearly nonsense. The fact is, as time goes on, more towns and cities are destroyed and then fall to the Russians. In two months, the area under Russian control – originally just the breakaway parts of Donbas – has grown to perhaps five times the size. If Russia continues to suffer “defeats” at this pace, then in another two months the entire south of Ukraine will be in ruins, cities such as Odesa will resemble Mariupol, and thousands upon thousands more Ukrainians will have died. Worse, as the war goes on, and more towns are destroyed, it becomes less likely that Ukrainians who have fled to other countries will ever return, because they will have no homes or workplaces to come back to. How many citizens of Mariupol will ever return? If Russia’s aim was to exterminate the Ukrainian nation, then the west’s approach is helping to do just that. Surely, if the lives of Ukrainian people are our concern then the west has to do something to stop the war – now. Encouraging the Ukrainians to continue, however just their cause, is merely making their country uninhabitable. The trouble is, there are only two ways to stop the war quickly, and neither is palatable to most western leaders. One would be for Nato to enter the war and make a quick, massive and decisive strike to cripple Russia’s invasion forces. Unlike with Russia’s actions, it would have every right under international law to do so. When Putin intervened in Syria, he very carefully framed this as a response to a request from Syria’s legitimate and internationally recognised government. The west could do the same in Ukraine. Putin himself has no such justification for his invasion. The risk involved in this – of a third world war – is obvious, and it’s why the west refuses to intervene directly. The other option is to persuade Putin to implement an immediate ceasefire, by inviting Russia to comprehensive peace talks. Western leaders are disinclined to parley with a butcher such as Putin. But they did it with Serbia’s Slobodan Milošević, only months after the massacre at Srebrenica, and the result was the Dayton agreement that put an end to the war in Bosnia in 1995. To get Putin to the negotiating table at all, everything would have to be up for discussion – including Ukraine’s borders, Russia’s age-old security concerns, perhaps even the very logic of basing today’s international frontiers in that part of Europe on what were internal borders in the USSR, drawn up by communist leaders precisely to prevent Soviet republics and regions from being viable independent states. The outcome of the talks does not need to be predetermined. The important thing is to talk rather than fight. Western leaders cannot bring themselves to broach these matters, which would seem to reward Putin for attempting to redraw the map by force. They would rather fight – or more accurately, let Ukraine fight, in the hope of defeating Russia. But if one thing is certain it is that Putin will never accept defeat. He is already too deeply invested in this war to back off with nothing to show for it. If western leaders think that their arms-length encouragement of Ukraine will bring about a Ukrainian military victory, then they are fatally misreading Putin’s intentions and resolve. For Ukraine’s sake, we need to stop him now, one way or the other, before nothing is left of the country we want to protect.

António Guterres was touring Borodianka on Thursday, where Russian forces are accused of massacring civilians before their withdrawal, on his first visit to Ukraine since the start of the invasion on 24 February, before talks with President Volodymyr Zelenskiy.  “I imagine my family in one of those houses that is now destroyed and black,” said the UN secretary general, who has been criticised for visiting Ukraine only after having first met Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, in Moscow. “I see my granddaughters running away in panic,” Guterres said. “The war is an absurdity in the 21st century. The war is evil. There is no way a war can be acceptable in the 21st century.” Guterres was accompanied by local military and civilian governors who showed him residential buildings that had been destroyed in Russian attacks. He was also due to visit the towns of Bucha and Irpin, sites of further alleged Russian war crimes. map of Ukraine The Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov warned on Thursday that an increased western supply of heavy weapons to Kyiv – as urged by the British foreign secretary, Liz Truss, on Wednesday – would endanger European security. “The tendency to pump weapons, including heavy weapons, into Ukraine, these are the actions that threaten the security of the continent, provoke instability,” Peskov said in response to Truss’s call for Kyiv’s allies to “ramp up” military production, including tanks and planes, to help Ukraine. Maria Zakharova, Russia’s foreign ministry spokesperson, also warned the west on Thursday to stop encouraging Ukraine to strike at targets inside Russian territory, saying it was “trying our patience”. Multiple targets, including fuel and ammunition depots, have been hit in Russian provinces bordering Ukraine in recent days. ‘We Ukrainians know how to turn suffering into strength’: Gogol Bordello’s Eugene Hütz on his musical resistance Read more “Such aggression against Russia cannot remain without an answer,” Zakharova said. “We would like Kyiv and western capitals to take seriously the statement that further provocation prompting Ukraine to strike against Russian facilities will be met with a harsh response from Russia.” Zakharova added that western envoys in Ukraine would not be immune from Russian retaliatory attacks, saying “advisers from western countries” in Ukraine “will not necessarily be a problem for Russia’s response measures”. The senior Ukrainian presidential aide Mykhailo Podolyak defended Ukraine’s right to strike inside Russian, saying: “Ukraine will defend itself in any way, including strikes on the warehouses and bases of the killers in Russia. The world recognises this right.” Britain’s defence secretary, Ben Wallace, on Thursday also repeated the UK’s assertion that it was “legitimate under international law” for Ukrainian forces to target Russian logistics infrastructure, but he said such attacks were unlikely to use British weapons. He also denied Nato was locked in a “proxy war” with Russia, but said the west would provide increased support to Ukraine if the Russian attacks continued. “Sometimes that will include planes and tanks,” he said, adding that he expected Putin, “having failed in nearly all his objectives” to dig in “like a cancerous growth”.  Germany’s parliament on Thursday overwhelmingly approved a petition backing the delivery of weapons, including heavy arms, to Ukraine to help it fend off Russian attacks. As Russia’s assault on Ukraine, now in its 10th week, continues to radically reshape security and economic ties across Europe, Nato’s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, said non-aligned Finland and Sweden would be welcome in the alliance. “It is, of course, for Finland and Sweden to decide whether they would like to apply for membership in Nato or not,” Stoltenberg said on Thursday. “But if they decide to apply, Finland and Sweden will be welcomed with open arms.” Nordic media said this week the two countries, which are deliberating the question of Nato membership, had agreed to submit simultaneous applications to the US-led alliance in mid-May. Moscow has said that would force it to bolster its defences in the Baltic, including with nuclear weapons, to “restore balance”. While Russia presses its military offensive in eastern and southern Ukraine, its economic battle with the west threatens to disrupt gas supplies to Europe. In a retaliatory strike against western sanctions, Moscow on Wednesday halted gas deliveries to Poland and Bulgaria for refusing to pay for supplies in roubles, a move Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, called “blackmail”. Zelenskiy repeated the term in an overnight national address, saying Moscow’s “European energy blackmail” showed it considered “not only gas, but any trade as a weapon” and that “no one in Europe can hope to maintain any normal economic cooperation with Russia”. The Financial Times, however, reported that some of Europe’s largest gas importers in Germany, Austria, Hungary and Slovakia were preparing to pay for their supplies in roubles via accounts with Russia’s Gazprombank .

The Russian president told lawmakers in St Petersburg on Wednesday the west wanted to cut Russia into pieces and accused it of pushing Ukraine into conflict with Moscow. “If someone intends to intervene in the ongoing events from the outside, and create strategic threats for Russia that are unacceptable to us, they should know that our retaliatory strikes will be lightning-fast,” said Putin.  “We have all the tools for this, things no one else can boast of having now. And we will not boast, we will use them if necessary. And I want everyone to know that.” His comments came as British foreign secretary Liz Truss called for a “doubling down” on support for Ukraine in a speech on Wednesday night, including further supplies of heavy weapons, and for allies to push for Russian forces to entirely leave Ukraine’s territory, with the country reverting to its pre-2014 borders. In reference to Russian-occupied areas in the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine, she said: “We are going to keep going further and faster to push Russia out of the whole of Ukraine.” There has been speculation that Ukraine would settle for a return to the pre-invasion status quo where territory was ceded to de facto Russian-backed separatists. She called Putin “a desperate rogue operator with no interest in international norms”. “Some argue we shouldn’t provide heavy weapons for fear of provoking something worse. But my view, is that inaction would be the greatest provocation. This is a time for courage not for caution,” she said, admitting that more should have been done to deter an invasion. Truss warned Putin that the west would come to the defence of Moldova in the same way as it is defending Ukraine if Russia mounted an attack there, as seems possible. She said the UK was digging deep into its inventories, including heavy weapons, tanks and aeroplanes, to defend Ukraine and other countries threatened by Russia. She also said future Russian access to the global economy “will depend on playing by the rules. There can be no more free passes”. In other developments: The United Nations secretary general, António Guterres, has arrived in Ukraine after meeting Putin and his foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, in Moscow. Guterres will meet the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, on Thursday.
Russia warned other EU customers may be cut off from its natural gas supplies if they refuse to pay in roubles. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov’s comments came after Russia halted gas supplies to Poland and Bulgaria, a move that European leaders and Zelenskiy denounced as “blackmail”.
The damage bill from the war has reached $600bn, Zelenskiy said in a video address on Wednesday night. “More than 32m square metres of living space, more than 1,500 educational facilities and more than 350 medical facilities have been destroyed or damaged,” he said. “About 2,500km of roads and almost 300 bridges have been ruined or damaged.”
A series of explosions were heard near a TV tower in the Russian-occupied southern Ukrainian city of Kherson on Wednesday night, temporarily knocking Russian channels off the air, Ukrainian and Russian news organisations reported. RIA Novosti said the broadcast later resumed. Russian channels began broadcasting from Kherson last week, it reported. The G7 group of industrialised nations is examining whether it could reimpose the current punitive economic sanctions if Russia tries to renege on a hypothetical future peace deal imposed by western allies. Britain has long said the war must end with Putin being seen to fail, but the containment terms being proposed by western officials include a permanent weakening of the Russian military forces so they can no longer pose a threat to eastern Europe, as well as Russia pulling out of all territory it has occupied, including Crimea, which it annexed in 2014. Lloyd Austin, the US defence secretary, this week in Germany hinted at the thinking by saying the US wanted the war to end with Russia so weakened it could not repeat its attack on Ukraine. British thinking reflects a growing confidence that the political, economic and military forces ranged against Putin can, in the long term, lead to his complete defeat. London also detects a change of mood in Washington – and to a lesser extent, Berlin – including a greater willingness to supply weaponry to Nato standards rather than hand-downs from old Warsaw Pact armoury. Britain envisages the security guarantees to Kyiv would largely consist of a commitment to arm Ukraine enough that Russia would not mount an attack. Britain does not favour a Nato-style commitment that Ukraine’s allies would intervene to protect Ukraine if it was threatened by Russia. Critics will say very tough settlement demands run the risk of forcing Putin into a corner so that he threatens the use of tactical weapons. But the Russian leader has already threatened to use nuclear weapons if red lines were crossed. In her speech, Truss also set out a warning to China claiming its rise will not be inevitable if it ignores the rules.

In a speech at Mansion House in London on Wednesday, Liz Truss renewed calls to boost Nato in the wake of the Ukraine war, and said the coordinated moves to isolate Russia from the world economy proved that market access to democratic countries was no longer a given. Truss also delivered a direct warning to China.  “Countries must play by the rules. And that includes China,” she said. On Thursday Wang Wenbin, a spokesman for China’s ministry of foreign affairs, dismissed Truss’s comments and accused Nato of demanding other countries abide by basic norms while it has “wantonly waged wars and dropped bombs in sovereign states, killing and displacing innocent civilians”. “Nato, a military organisation in the North Atlantic, has in recent years come to the Asia-Pacific region to throw its weight around and stir up conflicts,” Wang said. “Nato has messed up Europe. Is it now trying to mess up the Asia-Pacific and even the world?” Putin threatens Ukraine allies as Truss urges ‘doubling down’ on support for KyivRead more In her speech Truss said Nato had to pre-empt threats in the Indo-Pacific and extend its outlook to democracies outside its membership, like Taiwan, which Beijing claims is a breakaway Chinese province it must retake. She suggested China’s economic rise – now the world’s second largest economy to Britain’s sixth – could be targeted. “[China] will not continue to rise if they do not play by the rules. China needs trade with the G7. We [the Group of Seven] represent around half of the global economy. And we have choices,” Truss said. “We have shown with Russia the kind of choices that we’re prepared to make when international rules are violated.” China has refused to condemn the invasion of Ukraine by Russia, one of its closest allies, drawing criticism and urgings from European and other governments to use its influence on Moscow. A recent China-EU summit was reportedly strained as Chinese representatives rebuffed pressure by European counterparts to help end the war. Premier Li Keqiang said Beijing would pursue peace “in its own way”. Beijing firmly opposes linking the Ukraine war to its relations with Moscow and has said it will defend the rights of Chinese individuals and companies. On Thursday Wang said China’s position on the conflict had been “consistent and clear”. “We have always made independent judgments based on the merits of the case,” he said, adding no further detail.

And the order of the occupiers in that part of Mariupol which they unfortunately still control differs insignificantly from what the Nazis did in the occupied territory of Eastern Europe.

In Donbas, the occupiers are doing everything to destroy any life in this area. Constant brutal bombings, constant Russian strikes at infrastructure and residential areas show that Russia wants to make this area uninhabited. “Describing the situation in the temporarily occupied areas of the Kherson region, Zelenskiy said Russian forces are allegedly preparing for the transition to the “ruble zone”. “Any attempt to transfer our territory to Russia’s administrative, monetary, or any other system will mean only one thing: Russia itself will suffer from that,” he said. “Our responses, sanctions and other reactions of the free world to Russia’s aggressive actions will not be delayed.” Updated at 01.52 BST 30 Apr 202207.22Thank you for following our live coverage of the war in Ukraine.This blog has now closed.

In comments to China’s Xinhua news agency, Lavrov said:At present, the Russian and Ukrainian delegations are actually discussing a draft of a possible treaty via videoconferencing on a daily basis. 
This document should fix such elements of the post-conflict state of affairs as permanent neutrality, non-nuclear, non-bloc and demilitarised status of Ukraine, as well as guarantees of its security. 
The agenda of the talks also includes issues of denazification, recognition of new geopolitical realities, the lifting of sanctions, the status of the Russian language, and others. 
The settlement of the situation in Ukraine will make it possible to make a significant contribution to the de-escalation of military-political tension in Europe, and in the world as a whole. 
As one of the possible options, the creation of an institution of guarantor states is envisaged, among which, first of all, are the permanent members of the UN Security Council, including Russia and China.”“We are in favour of continuing the negotiations, although they are not going well,” Lavrov added. Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has insisted that western sanctions on Russia needed to be strengthened and could not be part of negotiations. 30 Apr 202206.05SummaryIf you have just joined us, here is comprehensive re-cap of where things stand:
Any foreign weapons shipment to Ukraine is a “legitimate target” for Russia, its foreign minister Sergey Lavrov said in an interview with Al Arabiya television channel, as cited by RIA Novosti. “Because those weapons are to be handed to the regime that is waging a war against its own population, against civilians in the country’s east,” Lavrov said.
The sooner the west comes to terms with “new geopolitical realities” the better it will be for itself and the international community, Lavrov warned. “Our special military operation in Ukraine also contributes to the process of freeing the world from the neo-colonial oppression of the west, heavily mixed with racism and an exclusiveness complex,” he said.
Russia claims Nato is trying to interfere with reaching political settlement to end the crisis in Ukraine. “By publicly expressing support for the Kyiv regime, Nato countries are doing everything to prevent the completion of the operation by reaching political agreements,” Lavrov said in a rare interview with China’s official Xinhua news agency. “If the US and Nato are really interested in resolving the Ukrainian crisis, then, firstly, they should change their minds and stop supplying arms and ammunition to Kyiv.”
Ukraine has claimed “colossal” Russian losses have taken place in the effort to fully capture the eastern Donbas region. While acknowledging its own heavy losses from Russia’s attacks in the east, Kyiv said casualties in the invading army were worse. “We have serious losses, but the Russians’ losses are much much bigger … They have colossal losses,” said a Ukrainian presidential adviser, Oleksiy Arestovych.
The Pentagon press secretary, John Kirby, has spoken of Vladimir Putin’s “cruelty and depravity” in Ukraine, calling his actions “unconscionable” and his justifications for the invasion “BS”. “It’s hard to square his … BS that this is about nazism in Ukraine, and it’s about protecting Russians in Ukraine, and it’s about defending Russian national interests, when none of them, none of them were threatened by Ukraine,” Kirby said. “It’s brutality of the coldest and the most depraved sort.”
European Union countries are likely to approve a phased embargo on Russian oil as early as next week, according to EU officials. European ambassadors are reportedly expected to agree to a finalised proposal by the end of next week after meeting on Wednesday, according to several EU officials and diplomats involved in the process.
The US did not believe the threat of Russia using nuclear weapons despite a recent escalation in Moscow’s rhetoric, a senior US defence official said. Russia was days behind its schedule on its military operations in Ukraine’s Donbas region, a US defence official said, and Russia’s fighting with Ukraine in the Donbas region would be a potential “knife fight”.
Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy described a Russian airstrike on Kyiv during a visit by the UN secretary general, António Guterres as a “deliberate and brutal humiliation” that was “left without a powerful response”. 
The situation inside the besieged Azovstal steel plant in the city of Mariupol was “beyond a humanitarian catastrophe”, a Ukrainian commander inside the facility said. Serhiy Volyna, from the 36th separate marine brigade, said there were hundreds of people in the steelworks, including 60 young people, the youngest of them four months old. Ukraine hoped to evacuate civilians holed up in the steel plant with the last fighters defending the southern city, Zelenskiy’s office said. The president described the besieged city as a “Russian concentration camp in the middle of ruins”.
Two British aid workers who were reportedly captured by Russian forces in Ukraine have been named. Presidium Network, a UK-based company that says it carries out evacuations of families and individuals from war zones, identified Paul Urey and Dylan Healy as the captured men. The UK Foreign Office said it was seeking further information about the claims of their capture.
A former US marine has been killed fighting alongside Ukrainian forces, the first US citizen known to have died in combat in the war with Russia. Willy Joseph Cancel, 22, was killed on Monday while working for a military contracting company that sent him to Ukraine, his mother told CNN. The US defence department warned US citizens that they should not go to Ukraine to fight.
More than 1 million people have been “evacuated from Ukraine” into Russia since 24 February, Russia’s foreign minister Sergei Lavrov claimed in remarks published by the ministry early on Saturday. Ukraine has said that Moscow has forcefully deported thousands of people to Russia with humanitarian corridors repeatedly breaking down.
The US speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi, said it would vote to pass Joe Biden’s $33bn request for aid for Ukraine “as soon as possible”. Speaking at her weekly press briefing on Friday morning, the House speaker framed the administration’s request as one of a number of “emergencies” Congress needed to address urgently.
Shipments of new US military aid are en route to Ukraine with 155mm shells, fuses and helmets bound for Ukraine loaded on aircraft pallets on a C-17 cargo aircraft on Friday at Dover Air Force Base, Delaware.
Britain will send investigators to Ukraine to help gather evidence of war crimes, including sexual violence, the foreign secretary, Liz Truss, has said. Ukrainian prosecutors and the international criminal court have been investigating potential war crimes in Ukraine since Russia’s 24 February invasion.
The US has begun training Ukrainian armed forces at sites located outside Ukraine. A Pentagon spokesperson said it was happening at three sites outside the US, including one in Germany.
Putin could announce the mass mobilisation of Russians on 9 May, Ben Wallace, the UK defence secretary, has said. Wallace said that Putin could declare that “we are now at war with the world’s nazis and we need to mass mobilise the Russian people”.
Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said that since Russia’s withdrawal from Kyiv, 900 bodies had been uncovered in mass graves. The Guardian’s Lorenzo Tondo confirmed with the deputy head prosecutor of Kyiv’s region that 900 bodies had been found so far, buried in several mass graves around the region.
In his latest address, Zelenskiy thanked the US for its support via a revived second world war-era lend-lease programme. He also thanked countries that have resumed diplomatic operations in Kyiv, saying: “Such gestures, together with strong defensive, financial and political support from the free world, mean that the need to end the war is becoming more and more obvious to Russia.”
The United States has rejected the possibility of “business as usual” with Russian President Vladimir Putin after after Indonesia invited him to the upcoming Group of 20 summit in November. 
Updated at 09.42 BST 30 Apr 202205.55Russia’ foreign minister also thanked Beijing for their “balanced position” on Ukraine.We are grateful to Beijing, as well as to other BRICS partners, for their balanced position on the Ukrainian issue,” Lavrov said. 30 Apr 202205.15The sooner the west comes to terms with 'new geopolitical realities', the better it will be, Lavrov saysRussia’s foreign minister doubled down on his assertions against the west, claiming “the sooner” the west comes to terms with “new geopolitical realities” the better it will be for itself and the international community.Today we are not talking about a new ‘cold war’, but, as I have already noted, about the persistent desire of Washington and its satellites, who imagine themselves to be ‘arbiters of the fate of mankind’, to impose an American-centric model of the world order. 
It has gotten to the point that the western minority is trying to replace the UN-centric architecture and international law formed after the Second World War with their own ‘rule-based order’. These rules are written by Washington and its allies themselves and then imposed on the international community as binding.Russia’s foreign minister Sergey Lavrov claimed “the sooner” the west comes to terms with “new geopolitical realities” the better it will be. Photograph: Anadolu Agency/Getty ImagesLavrov continued to argue that those “who pursue an independent course in domestic and foreign policy” are suppressed by the west “by the most brutal methods”. Obviously, the attempts of the ‘collective west’ to impede the natural course of history, to solve their problems at the expense of others, are doomed. Today’s world has several decision-making centres, it is multipolar. We see how the states of Asia, Africa and Latin America are developing dynamically. Everyone has a real freedom of choice, including ways of development and participation in integration projects.
Our special military operation in Ukraine also contributes to the process of freeing the world from the neo-colonial oppression of the west, heavily mixed with racism and an exclusiveness complex.”The sooner the West comes to terms with the new geopolitical realities, the better it will be for itself and for the entire international community.”Updated at 05.17 BST 30 Apr 202204.39More than 1 million people have been “evacuated from Ukraine” into Russia since 24 February, Russia’s foreign minister Sergei Lavrov claimed in remarks published by the ministry early on Saturday.Lavrov claimed the hotline of Russia’s interdepartmental coordination headquarters for humanitarian response received requests for assistance in evacuating 2.8 million people to Russia, of which 16,000 were foreign citizens and employees of UN and OSCE international missions. “In total, 1.02 million people were evacuated from Ukraine, the DPR and the LPR, of which over 120 thousand citizens of third countries,” the foreign minister said in comments made to China’s Xinhua news agency.Ukraine has said that Moscow has forcefully deported thousands of people to Russia with humanitarian corridors repeatedly breaking down.According to data from the United Nations, more than 5.4 million people have fled Ukraine since the start of the invasion. 30 Apr 202204.14Nato countries are 'doing everything to prevent' negotiated cease fire, Lavrov saysRussian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov has had some stern words to say about the west’s involvement in Ukraine in a rare interview with China’s official Xinhua news agency.The transcript from the interview was published on the Russian foreign ministry’s website early Saturday morning. Among a string of assertions, the foreign minister accused the United States and Nato countries of using Ukraine as “one of the tools to contain Russia” while maintaining that prior to Russia’s invasion on 24 February they were “forcing Kyiv to make an artificial, false choice: either with the West or with Moscow.”Over the past years, the United States and its allies have done nothing to stop the intra-Ukrainian conflict ... they ‘pumped up’ the Kyiv regime with weapons, trained and armed the Ukrainian army and nationalist battalions, and generally carried out the military-political development of the territory of Ukraine. They encouraged the aggressive anti-Russian course pursued by the Kyiv authorities.”It was these conditions that gave Russia “no other choice” but to recognise the Donetsk and Luhansk People’s Republics and launch a “special military operation” to demilitarise and denazify Ukraine, Lavrov continued.In fact, Nato countries are “doing everything to prevent” a negotiated cease fire with Ukraine, Lavrov maintained. By publicly expressing support for the Kyiv regime, Nato countries are doing everything to prevent the completion of the operation by reaching political agreements. 
Various weapons are sent to Ukraine through Poland and other Nato countries in an endless stream. 
All this is done under the pretext of ‘fighting the invasion’, but, in fact, the US and the EU intend to fight Russia ‘to the last Ukrainian’, and they are absolutely indifferent to the fate of Ukraine as an independent subject of international relations.”If the US and Nato are really interested in resolving the Ukrainian crisis, then, firstly, they should change their minds and stop supplying arms and ammunition to Kyiv, Lavrov said, adding that Russia is “in favour” of continuing the negotiations, although “they are not going well”.These are militant rhetoric and inflammatory actions of Kyiv’s Western backers. They actually encourage him to ‘fight to the last Ukrainian’, pumping up the country with weapons and sending mercenaries there. I note that the Ukrainian special services, with the help of Westerners, staged a crude bloody provocation in Bucha, including to complicate the negotiation process.”Lavrov said it would only be possible to reach agreements when Kyiv begins to be guided by the interests of the Ukrainian people, and not “advisers from afar”.The “special military operation” launched on 24 February is “developing strictly according to plan” and all its goals “will be surely achieved, despite the opposition of our opponents,” the foreign minister concluded. Updated at 04.22 BST 30 Apr 202203.45The Australian Olympic Committee (AOC) will support Ukrainian athletes seeking to resettle in Australia on humanitarian grounds amid Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, outgoing AOC President John Coates said on Saturday.Coates told the AOC’s annual general meeting in Sydney that it was “sad” young Ukrainian athletes were swapping sports equipment to take up arms against Russia’s forces, Reuters reports the president as saying. “Today I announced that the AOC executive has by circular resolution last week, determined that the AOC will support humanitarian visa applications by Ukrainian athletes and will seek the assistance of you, our member sports, in their settlement requirements,” said Coates, who is also a vice president of the International Olympic Committee (IOC).Coates added that the AOC would contribute $100,000 to the IOC’s “Solidarity Fund” for the Ukrainian Olympic community.As Ukrainians are forced to defend their families and homes, Ukrainian athletes are amongst them.
Many have returned home for this purpose, and how sad it is that young men and women just swapped their rackets and running spikes for rifles and flak jackets.”“They have lost their right to membership of the international Olympic community. There are no stadiums for their colours, no poles for their flags, no music for their songs and no dais for their athletes,” Coates added. 30 Apr 202203.02Any weapons shipment to Ukraine is ‘legitimate target’ for Russia, Lavrov saysRussia’s “special military operation” in Ukraine will be finished as soon as its objectives are achieved, Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov has said in an interview with Al Arabiya television channel, as cited by RIA Novosti.“It will be completed as soon as the goals, which I have already described, are accomplished and achieved,” he said.In Lavrov’s view, any weapons shipment to Ukraine is a legitimate target, RIA reported.Because those weapons are to be handed to the regime that is waging a war against its own population, against civilians in the country’s east,” he said.The minister emphasised that the special operation was a response to what Nato was doing in Ukraine to prepare it for an aggressive stand against Russia.They were provided with offensive weapons, including the weapons capable of reaching Russian territory. Military bases were built, including at the Sea of Azov. Dozens of military exercises were conducted, and many of them on Ukrainian soil with Nato assistance. And most of those drills were aimed against Russia’s interests. Therefore, the goal of this operation is to make sure that those plans do not materialise,” the Russian foreign minister said. “It has become evident that the goals of the military operation, which I have described, must be accomplished. I can assure you that during this military operation the Kiev regime’s escapades have been taken care of,” the foreign minister added. 30 Apr 202202.39Shipments of new US military aid are en route to Ukraine after President Joe Biden asked Congress on Thursday for $33bn to bolster Ukraine’s fight against Russia.In the images below, airmen and women with the 436th Aerial Port Squadron place 155mm shells, fused and helmets on aircraft pallets ultimately bound for Ukraine on a C-17 cargo aircraft on Friday at Dover Air Force Base, Delaware.

Lenin would tell the west it must take risks to win,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/may/01/what-is-to-be-done-lenin-west-wont-win-in-ukraine-without-taking-risks,"They named themselves the Ukraine Defence Consultative Group and vowed to meet monthly until the war is won. A catchier, more accurate title would be the Stop Mad Vlad Coalition. That’s surely how Russia’s friendless, paranoid president will view the US-led inaugural meeting of 40 Nato and non-Nato countries opposed to Russia’s invasion. Even embarrassed China now steers clear of Moscow’s Beria tribute act.  The group’s launch was one of numerous political, rhetorical and military escalations last week – by both sides – that are rapidly transforming the Ukraine war into a fully fledged, open-ended international conflict. That in turn raises an alarming question: is all this fighting talk, all these threats and brinkmanship leading ineluctably towards nuclear confrontation? Sergei Lavrov, Russia’s foreign minister, purposefully conjured that terrifying prospect when he claimed Nato’s “proxy war” in Ukraine could trigger a third world war. Like a street corner spiv practising crude blackmail, Lavrov claimed there was a “considerable risk” such a war might go nuclear. Presumably he knows this because Putin is actually considering it. Liz Truss, Lavrov’s British counterpart, dodged the nuclear question in her Mansion House speech – but went for the jugular. Her bold declaration that total victory, plus the liberation of all occupied Ukrainian territory including Crimea, was a “strategic imperative” for the west may have surprised less gung-ho Nato allies who foolishly didn’t realise she speaks for them. If Putin won, “we would never feel safe again,” Truss warned. By her reasoning, Putin has to go – preferably before the next Tory leadership contest. America’s tone has hardened significantly, too. US president Joe Biden says he stands by his vow in March that Putin “cannot remain in power”. Lloyd Austin, his defence secretary, now says the US wants Russia permanently “weakened”. It should never again have the capability to threaten its neighbours, he said. Does Austin actually expect Putin to disarm? Despite denials, such loose statements sound like a push for regime change, even as Biden seeks a whopping $33bn in extra funding. Putin has also recklessly raised the stakes, threatening “retaliatory strikes as quick as lightning” against anyone meddling in Ukraine. To make his contemptuous point, he bombed António Guterres, the UN chief, who was visiting Kyiv. Russia says it may target Nato arms supply convoys. Explosions last week in a disputed region of Moldova are believed to be Russian false flag operations. This shows how easily the war could spread. In many ways, it already has. Oil depots are ablaze in southern Russia. Poland protested it was under “direct attack” after Moscow blocked gas supplies. The cut-off was denounced as a hostile act against Nato and the EU. Germany fears it may be next. But Berlin has nevertheless bowed to peer pressure to supply heavy weapons to Kyiv. Additional EU sanctions, including on oil, are imminent. All of this fuels an expanding fire. Biden has repeatedly insisted the conflict will be contained. “Direct confrontation between Nato and Russia is world war three, something we must strive to prevent,” he said after the invasion began. But war has its own deathly momentum. Daily acts of escalation point in one direction. Nato is like a patient in denial. The reality, by many measures, is that it’s already at war with Russia. Future historians may map the path to wider conflagration in the same way the origins of the first world war were traced Perhaps future historians of the Ukraine conflict will map the path to wider conflagration in the same way academic predecessors traced the origins of the first world war. It’s not hard to discern the developing pattern right now. Grievance, provocation, reaction, escalation, explosion. It’s unravelling in plain sight. Yet unlike in 1914, or during the first cold war, there are no agreed limits or rules in this fight. Worldwide, from Iran to North Korea, counter-proliferation efforts fail. Nuclear arms control treaties lapse. A revived global nuclear arms race accelerates. Military planners have normalised the use of low-yield tactical (battlefield) nukes. Russian doctrine reserves the right to go nuclear in response to conventional threats, if the state (or leadership) is at risk. Russia’s test last month of the nuclear-capable “Satan II” long-range missile carried a clear warning. “Given the setbacks they [Russia] have faced so far militarily, none of us can take lightly the threat posed by a potential resort to tactical nuclear weapons,” CIA director William Burns warned. It’s clear the west cannot abandon Ukraine simply out of fear over how far manic Putin might go. Such a collapse would wreck the global order, the UN, and Europe’s security. Yet the longer the war rages, the bigger the risk of a different kind of cataclysmic, world-changing event. So here’s the choice, as the northern English say: piss or get off the pot. Either the western allies act decisively, right now, to halt this war by demanding an immediate ceasefire and threatening and, if necessary, launching direct military intervention to secure it – as previously urged in this space. Or, alternatively, Truss, Austin and other hawks stop stoking the fire and setting unrealistic goals, and instead advise Kyiv to accept a negotiated settlement that, regrettably, will inevitably reward Putin’s aggression. Many find both choices disturbing. At present, forceful Nato intervention to “stop Mad Vlad” remains unlikely because Biden, principally, believes it’s too risky – even though he dearly wants shot of him. No one in Kyiv favours a “peace” deal at any price, as Guterres discovered. Nor will Putin give ground. On the contrary, he wants more. Thus, in all probability, this war will grind on, murderously, chaotically, ruinously, amid the ever-present risk that uncontrolled escalation may produce a nuclear catastrophe. As Lenin famously asked: what is to be done?",,,,

Sweden and neighbour Finland stayed out of Nato during the cold war, but Russia’s annexation of Crimea in 2014 and its invasion of Ukraine have led the countries to rethink their security policies, with Nato membership looking increasingly likely.  Both countries are concerned they would be vulnerable during an application process, which could take up to a year to be approved by all Nato’s members. “Naturally, I’m not going to go into any details, but I feel very sure that now we have an American assurance,” Linde told Swedish TV from Washington after meeting US secretary of state Antony Blinken. “However, not concrete security guarantees, those you can only get if you are a full member of Nato,” she added. Linde declined to say what assurances she had received from Blinken. “They would mean that Russia can be clear that if they direct any kind of negative activities against Sweden, which they have threatened, it would not be something that the US would just allow to happen … without a response,” she said.

Is Brazil ready for the next incarnation of President Lula?Read more  In an interview with Time magazine published on Wednesday, the former president said it was irresponsible for western leaders to celebrate Zelenskiy because they are encouraging war instead of focusing on closed-door negotiations to stop the fighting. “I see the president of Ukraine, speaking on television, being applauded, getting a standing ovation by all the [European] parliamentarians,” Lula told the magazine. “This guy [Zelenskiy] is as responsible as Putin for the war,” he added. Lula, who is on Time’s cover this week, is frontrunner for the October elections when he hopes to deny far-right President Jair Bolsonaro re-election and return to office after the annulment last year of corruption convictions that had put him in jail. The remarks will probably raise eyebrows in the US and Europe, which are supplying military support to Ukraine and have hit Russia with punishing sanctions over an invasion widely seen in the west as an act of unprovoked Russian aggression. Lula, 76, said Zelenskiy should have yielded to Russian opposition to Ukraine’s moves to join Nato and held negotiations with Putin to avoid a conflict. Refering to Zelenskiy’s rise to fame as an actor and comedian, he added: “We should be having a serious conversation. OK, you were a nice comedian. But let us not make war for you to show up on TV.” The veteran leftist said Biden and European Union leaders failed to do enough to negotiate with Russia in the run-up to its invasion of Ukraine in February. “The United States has a lot of political clout. And Biden could have avoided war, not incited it,” he said. “Biden could have taken a plane to Moscow to talk to Putin. This is the kind of attitude you expect from a leader.” The US and EU could have avoided the invasion by stating that Ukraine would not join Nato, he said. “Putin shouldn’t have invaded Ukraine. But it’s not just Putin who is guilty. The US and the EU are also guilty,” Lula said Lula, who leads Bolsonaro in the polls for October’s elections, was a key player on the international stage during his two terms as president, building Brazil’s diplomatic clout.

Sweden is due to publish a security policy assessment report by 13 May, two-weeks earlier than planned, which will involve representatives of all parties in Sweden’s parliament, the Riksdag.  The foreign ministry is also due to issue a position paper, before a decision is taken by the coalition government, no later than 24 May. The Social Democrats are eager to avoid a split over an issue that challenges nearly 200 years of Swedish neutrality with a national election in the autumn. However, local media in Sweden reported the climate and environment minister, Annika Strandhäll, who is also the federal board chair of the women’s wing of the Social Democrats, as saying the faction had “a long history and struggle in matters concerning peace, disarmament, detente and military freedom of alliance”. Therefore, Strandhäll said: “[We] in the federal board have decided to remain in line with our congressional decisions that Sweden should be militarily non-aligned and stand outside Nato.” Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BST The Finnish president, Sauli Niinistö, has said he will make his views known by 12 May, giving himself time to react to what Vladimir Putin may say on Russia’s Victory Day on 9 May. Moscow has rejected reports that Putin will declare war on Europe on 9 May but it has threatened unspecified consequences if Nato accepts the two countries as members. There has been a sudden change in Finnish public opinion towards Russia after the invasion of Ukraine with many voters lacking trust in Russia, with whom Finland shares a 830-mile border. Surveys of the Finnish parliament show close to two-thirds of ministers are in favour of Nato membership. The ruling Finnish Social Democrats are due to hold a debate on 14 May. The parliament is taking expert evidence on the plan, but opinion polls show steady support for membership in the wake of Putin’s invasion of Ukraine. This increases to 80% if both the prime minister, Sanna Marin, and president back membership. President Niinistö is scheduled to make a two-day visit to Sweden later this month. ‘There will be no way back’: will war change Finland’s pragmatic approach to Russia?Read more The UK’s defence secretary, Ben Wallace, was in Finland on Wednesday in a show of solidarity as British troops took part in a joint exercises with Finnish, US and Estonian troops.

The claim in the New York Times, quoting unnamed defence officials, appears to confirm suspicions the US is supplying actionable intelligence in real time to help the Ukrainian military select high-value targets.  Appearing to confirm the claims, the Pentagon spokesperson, John Kirby, acknowledged the US was providing “Ukraine with information and intelligence that they can use to defend themselves”, although Adrienne Watson, a national security council spokesperson, said intelligence was not provided “with the intent to kill Russian generals”. The acknowledgment of US intelligence assistance in targeting Russian forces, which comes on top of another $20bn (£16bn) in promised weapons to Ukraine from Washington, is a further escalation in what is increasingly becoming a proxy war between the US, with its western allies, and Russian forces in Ukraine. Some European officials expressed uneasiness about the claims. “We have to be very careful on what we are briefing, for two reasons: for the security of the operations on the ground … and because we don’t want to go to war with Russia,” one said. Another, well briefed on the issue, said the claim was misleading. “I don’t think that the information published in the New York Times on the targeting of Russian generals is accurate,” the official said. “The reason why Ukrainian forces have succeeded in targeting Russian generals is simply because the Russians implement former Soviet Union doctrines. The Ukrainians are smart enough to know which area they need to target once the Russian troops are deployed on the ground.” It has also been suggested that a top-down decision-making tradition in the Russian military, combined with a failure of the army’s secure communications systems, has meant that generals have had to come to the frontline to give their orders directly, putting them in the line of fire. The Kremlin said on Thursday it was well aware that the US, Britain and other Nato countries were constantly feeding intelligence to the Ukrainian military and that this would not stop Russia from achieving its objectives. While Moscow has already said it was targeting western arms shipments arriving in Ukraine, it also threatened “lightning fast” retaliation after the UK defence minister James Heappey defended Ukraine striking targets inside Russia. According to the US officials, Washington has given Ukraine details on Russia’s expected troop movements and the location and other information about Russia’s mobile military headquarters, and Ukraine has combined that help with its own intelligence to conduct artillery strikes and other attacks that have killed Russian officers. Ukrainian officials said they had killed about 12 Russian generals on the battlefield. The most recent fatality apparently occurred at the weekend with the reported death of Maj Gen Andrei Simonov, a Russian electronic warfare commander, who Ukraine said it killed near the city of Izyum in the Kharkiv region, which is occupied by Russian forces. Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BST Justifying the sharp increase in military assistance to Ukraine last month, the US president, Joe Biden, made it clear Washington wanted to help shape conditions to assist Ukrainian forces in the current phase of the war, as Moscow has pivoted from its failed attempt to take Kyiv to focus on eastern and southern regions of the country. The New York Times reported the Biden administration had sought to keep much intelligence secret to avoid provoking Vladimir Putin into a wider war. That cautious calculation appears to have changed in recent weeks, as countries have voiced overt support for Ukraine and supplied far more lethal equipment, including much-needed artillery and ammunition. Summing up that mood last month, the US defence secretary, Lloyd Austin, said the US wanted “to see Russia weakened to the degree it cannot do the kinds of things that it has done in invading Ukraine”.

Although Johnson’s key guarantee is necessarily a political declaration, as opposed to an international treaty guarantee, the British commitment was of high value at a time of great tension, Anna Wieslander, the Atlantic Council’s northern Europe director said on Wednesday.  Johnson’s visits were designed to reassure the populations of both countries that in practical military defence terms key Nato countries, if not Nato collectively, are committed bilaterally to the Nordic countries’ defence if subject to attack or sustained Russian intimidation. 01:38Boris Johnson pledges UK support if Sweden were to come under attack – video The UK statement goes further than any bilateral guarantees made so far by any other Nato country and is designed to cover the potentially vulnerable transition period between Nato membership application and full membership, the point at which Nato’s full article 5 collective defence protections kicks in. That transition is perceived as the moment of maximum risk for Stockholm and Helsinki and could last as long as 12 months as each of the 30 Nato states must ratify their membership. In a visit to Washington last week Ann Linde, the Swedish foreign minister, was given a broad security assurance by Antony Blinken, the US secretary of state. Olaf Scholz, the German chancellor also promised to back the Nordics’ Nato membership when the Swedish prime minister, Magdalena Andersson, and her Finnish counterpart, Sanna Marin, travelled to Berlin last week. Björn Fägersten, senior research fellow at the Swedish Institute of International Affairs, said the British offer “gives an extra layer of assurance in the event of an attack. It is written down and Boris Johnson was quite specific in terms of talking about increased deployments by the military, air force and naval operations.” Wieslander said “at a time of very high tension in the region, it is of great value, and partly because it builds on what exists already through the agreements made at the time of the setting up of the joint expeditionary force in 2015. It also sends a signal to Russia that a nuclear power is willing to do this. I would expect the US to do something similar.” The declaration could not come in the form of a fully fledged treaty since that might take as long to ratify as Sweden’s Nato membership. In a decision that cuts deep into Swedish self-identity, the ruling Social Democrat board will decide on Sunday whether to end 200 years of neutrality, although many say the cooperation between Finland and Sweden with Nato members has been so close it was tantamount to Nato membership. Leftwing critics have said Sweden is behaving like a reindeer in a herd, running in the same direction as the rest. Fägersten said the meeting of the Social Democrats governing board was “the key decision point”, and predicted the party would join the non-left opposition parties in backing membership. “The statements from former foreign ministers such as Margot Wallström and the fact that Social Democrats have brought forward the decision to coincide with Finland’s timetable suggest there will be support.” Asked if he thought Johnson was the best message carrier to take into the Swedish social democratic debate, he said: “I don’t think Brexit or Partygate will affect Sweden’s thinking. We have seen that Britain has been pretty supportive of Ukraine from an early stage, and that has increased its credibility. Britain is a pretty popular country here. We would still like you to be EU members, but we cooperate a lot.” Support for Nato membership has not trailed off in Sweden since the Russian invasion of Ukraine on 24 February. A poll conducted by Demoskop for the daily newspaper Aftonbladet showed support for Nato membership still rising and reaching 61 %. The same organisation’s poll published on 20 April showed 57% of Swedes in favour of joining Nato, up from 51% in March. In addition, more than two-thirds of the Finnish parliament, according to surveys, now supports Nato membership. Finland, an EU member, has managed to balance criticism of Russia with a bridge-building role with Moscow, but may find that role harder to play once inside an alliance seen as Russia’s enemy. Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BST Defence experts are stressing that Sweden could maintain its special role in advocating peace and disarmament by following Norway and Denmark, two founding Nato members, in making a condition of membership a ban on their soil of both nuclear weapons in peacetime and permanent foreign troops. In practice this does not prevent near permanent rotational forces or pre-positioning of supplies. Security service chiefs have been surprised by the lack of direct Russian disinformation efforts in the Nordic debates, and Fägersten said it was possible that future Russian interference would focus instead in one of the 30 Nato states that would have to ratify the treaty possibly over the next 12 months. He said it was also possible Russia, preoccupied by the Ukraine front, simply did not have the resources to respond to the unforeseen emergence of a new Nato flank. Asked what kind of disruption was possible, Wieslander said: “The expectations are cyberattack, disinformation campaigns, electronic jamming, intrusions in our airspace, even something more official, that they have moved Iskander missiles into Kaliningrad [a Russian exclave sandwiched between Lithuania and Poland on the Baltic coast], but they have played with this card before. Their methods are designed to be ambiguous.”",,,,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f0f81220fd87046d8030d322899541caf2e03679/0_77_3528_2116/master/3528.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=a8ee66cc3c9fd67da779eaae32500b13

Holding a press conference with the Swedish prime minister, Magdalena Andersson, on his first stop on a daylong trip, Johnson said the type and extent of possible support would largely be governed by what Sweden might ask for.  Johnson had earlier signed mutual security agreements with Andersson. Later on Wednesday he signed a parallel deal with the Finnish president, Sauli Niinistö. The mutual agreements promise that if either country faced an attack or a disaster, they would “upon request from the affected country assist each other in a variety of ways, which may include military means”. Johnson’s security assurances to Sweden and Finland not just symbolic Read more At his press conference with Niinistö at the presidential palace in Helsinki, Johnson confirmed in response to a question that this could involve UK troops in Finland or Sweden: “Yes, we will come to each other’s assistance, including with military assistance.” While the wording is general, the impetus comes from the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the subsequent decisions of Sweden and Finland to consider applying for Nato membership, and Russia’s threats of consequences if this happens. 01:33Finland joining Nato would not be 'against anyone', its president says – video Asked at the Helsinki press conference about a potential hostile response from Russia if Finland opted to apply to join Nato, Niinistö said: “If that would be the case then my response would be: you caused this. Look in the mirror.” Speaking earlier alongside Andersson in Harpsund, the Swedish prime ministerial country retreat, Johnson said: “The war in Ukraine is forcing us all to make difficult decisions. But sovereign nations must be free to make those decisions without fear or influence or threat of retaliation.” Questioned about what the UK-Sweden agreement might mean in practical terms, Johnson remained largely vague, but did not completely demur when asked if it could go as far as the UK providing assistance with nuclear weapons. “This is about our joint decision to show that we will support and defend each other,” he said. “When it comes to our nuclear deterrent, that’s something we don’t generally comment upon, but what I’ve made clear is that it’s up to either party to make a request, and we take it very seriously.” Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday at 7am BST Johnson, who dodged questions on UK plans to potentially try to escape the post-Brexit Northern Ireland protocol, and his views on the Labour leader Keir Starmer’s pledge to resign if fined for breaching lockdown rules, said the deal was “the foundation stone” for closer links. “This declaration is something that is about the UK and Sweden standing together, affirming our friendship and our partnership, and our willingness to come to each other’s defence and support,” he said. Asked about Sweden’s decision over whether to apply to join Nato, Johnson said the UK would be supportive. “That’s not for me to comment upon except, of course, to say that I’m sure the UK will support whatever course of action Sweden decides to embark upon.” This article was amended on 11 May 2022 because an earlier version referred to Sauli Niinistö as the Finnish prime minister.

The French president’s warning was prompted by fears that the US, under Donald Trump, could no longer be relied upon to come to the defence of Nato allies. Mr Trump last month confirmed that he had threatened not to defend them against Russia. Fewer than three years on from Mr Macron’s warning, the alliance is reinvigorated. Members have increased defence spending significantly, though only eight out of 30 met the target of 2% of GDP last year. Finland and Sweden, long resistant to joining, are knocking on the door. Nothing has done more for Nato solidarity and expansion than Vladimir Putin’s brutal and unprovoked invasion of Ukraine. As the Swedish prime minister, Magdalena Andersson, observed: “There is a before and after 24 February.”  Finland’s president and prime minister, Sauli Niinistö and Sanna Marin, declared on Thursday that their country must apply to join without delay. Sweden’s ruling Social Democrats, long split over the issue, are now expected to opt for membership on Sunday. In Finland, support for Nato membership had never risen above 30% since the end of the cold war, and often fell below 20%. It currently stands at 76%. In Sweden, where non-alignment (preceded by neutrality) has been more ideological, rather than pragmatic, support has also surged: more than 57% of people now support membership. Both countries are receiving a warm welcome. Their membership would increase Nato’s ability to defend the Baltic. In reality, they are already close partners, taking part in exercises and sharing intelligence with the alliance. But entry would formally bind them to the common security guarantee set out in article 5 of the treaty, stating that an attack on any member is an attack on all, and committing members to defend each other. Nato expansion has doubtless contributed to Mr Putin’s paranoid mindset. He sees the organisation as little more than an expression of US power. But it is primarily Russian aggression that has driven expansion, not vice versa. The fear of provoking Moscow tied the hands of its neighbour Finland, and Sweden, for years. Now the all-out assault on Ukraine has led many to conclude that there is nothing to lose – while Russia’s failures there have suggested that it may be less fearsome than they thought. Sweden and Finland joining Nato would leave Kaliningrad, home of Moscow’s Baltic Sea fleet, encircled. Predictably, Russia has vowed retaliation for the Finnish announcement. It had already said it would deploy nuclear weapons in the Baltic, though the real threat is more likely to come in the form of disinformation, cyber-attacks, and other provocations. Yet Moscow should not be the alliance’s only concern. It must also look closer to home. In the US, 57 Republicans voted against the $40bn aid package for Ukraine in the House of Representatives and it faces Republican objections in the Senate. As the Democrats flounder, the spectre of Donald Trump – or someone like him – as the 47th president looms larger. And despite the defeat of Marine Le Pen in last month’s French presidential election, ambivalence or antagonism towards Nato has not vanished from Europe. In Italy, where a general election is due next year, most voters oppose the government’s decisions to increase defence spending and send arms to Ukraine. The alliance exists to counter the threat on its eastern borders. It can only do so by remaining vigilant to internal vulnerabilities.",/p/yexh2,70.0,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/may/12/the-guardian-view-on-expanding-nato-putin-has-only-himself-to-blame#comments,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2e2145da4da8bde80211b38cf3066f1f9ac053c1/0_0_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=d6a929be2e02724f58994111d5a14353

With neighbouring Sweden expected to follow suit, Sauli Niinistö, Finland’s president, and Sanna Marin, the prime minister, made the call in a joint statement, adding: “We hope that the national steps still needed to make this decision will be taken rapidly within the next few days.”  Nato membership would strengthen Finland’s security, the two leaders said, and as a member of Nato, “Finland would strengthen the entire defence alliance. Finland must apply for Nato membership as a matter of urgency”. Why are Sweden and Finland not yet in Nato and does the alliance want them?Read more The Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, said Russia would “definitely” see Finnish membership as a threat, and the foreign ministry in Moscow said it would have to take “military-technical” steps if Helsinki applied for Nato accession. “The expansion of Nato and the approach of the alliance to our borders does not make the world and our continent more stable and secure,” Peskov said. “Everything will depend on how this process takes place, how far the military infrastructure moves towards our borders.” Russia’s foreign ministry said Moscow would be “forced to take reciprocal steps … to address the resulting threats to its national security”. It accused Nato of seeking to create “another flank for the military threat to our country” and said Helsinki should “be aware of its responsibility and the consequences of such a move”. Graphic The Finnish daily Iltalehti reported that key Finnish politicians had been told Russia could halt gas supplies to Finland on Friday, although it did not say where the warning came from or whether it was in response to the Nato announcement. Finland shares an 810-mile (1,300km) border with Russia and has for decades maintained a strict policy of military non-alignment, viewing membership of the US-led alliance as an unnecessary provocation of Moscow. However, Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine on 24 February has led to a profound change in its thinking, and looks likely to usher in the very expansion of the western military alliance that the Russian president aimed to prevent. Public support for Nato membership has trebled in Finland, with the latest poll by the public broadcaster Yle showing 76% of Finns in favour compared with about 25% before the invasion, with only 12% against. The president, prime minister and senior cabinet ministers will meet on Sunday to make the formal decision on submitting Finland’s membership application. A positive decision would then be presented to parliament for approval early next week. 01:33Finland joining Nato would not be 'against anyone', its president says – video Sweden’s ruling Social Democrats are scheduled to decide on Sunday whether to overturn their longstanding opposition to Nato membership, paving the way for a probable application from Stockholm also to join the 30-nation alliance. Sweden’s foreign minister, Ann Linde, said Niinistö and Marin’s statement was “an important message”, adding that Finland was “Sweden’s closest security and defence partner” and its assessments “must be taken into account”. Sweden’s Expressen daily, citing unnamed sources, said Stockholm’s final decision would be made on Monday, with a formal application for membership to be submitted soon afterwards. Nordic media have previously said the two countries were likely to submit a joint application. Nato’s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, said Finland would be “warmly welcomed” into the alliance and promised the accession process would be “smooth and swift”, although ratification by all 30 members could take several months. Finland is one of Nato’s “closest partners, a mature democracy, a member of the European Union, and an important contributor to Euro-Atlantic security”, Stoltenberg said, adding that Finnish membership would prove that the alliance’s “door is open”. Russia has repeatedly warned Finland and Sweden against joining Nato, saying the “serious military and political consequences” of such a move would oblige it to “restore military balance” by strengthening its defences in the Baltic Sea region, including by deploying nuclear weapons. Dmitry Medvedev, the former Russian president, said on Thursday that western countries’ “proxy war with Russia” would “increase the likelihood of a direct and open conflict between Nato and Russia”. Urging the west not to “lie to yourself and others” and “choke in the paroxysms of Russophobia”, Medvedev said such a conflict “always has the risk of turning into a full-fledged nuclear war” and that this would be “catastrophic for everyone”. Other governments in the region, however, welcomed Helsinki’s statement. Denmark’s prime minister, Mette Frederiksen, said Finnish membership would “strengthen Nato and our common security”. Copenhagen would do everything for a quick admission process, she said. Germany’s chancellor, Olaf Scholz, tweeted his support, saying he had assured Niinistö of “the full support of the federal government” in a phone call. Estonia’s prime minister, Kaja Kallas, said her country supported Finland’s rapid accession. Poland’s prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, said Finland’s decision was “great news for Poland and Europe’s security”, and the prime minister of the Czech Republic, Petr Fiala, said his country would “of course” support a Finnish application to join the alliance. Finland’s foreign minister, Pekka Haavisto, told the European parliament accession to Nato would strengthen security in the region. Norway, Denmark and the three Baltic states were already Nato members and the addition of Finland would “bring added value”, he said.

The North Atlantic Treaty Organisation is a defensive military alliance formed in 1949 by 12 countries including the US, UK and France to counter the threat of postwar Soviet Russian expansion in Europe. Its common security guarantee is based on article 5 of the treaty, which states that an attack on one member is an attack on all and commits members to defend each other in the event of armed aggression. Why are Finland and Sweden not already members? Both considered that joining the alliance would represent an unnecessary provocation of Moscow, and so have long pursued policies of neutrality, and then non-alignment, to avoid antagonising a major regional power. Finland’s concerns have been largely practical: it shares an 810-mile (1,300km) border with Russia, declared independence in 1917 after more than a century of rule by Moscow, and its army twice fought off Soviet forces during the second world war before ceding about 10% of its territory. A 1948 agreement of friendship, cooperation and mutual assistance with Russia isolated Finland militarily from western Europe, though the breakup of the Soviet Union and EU membership have since allowed it to step out of Russia’s shadow. Sweden’s opposition to Nato membership has been more ideological. Its postwar foreign policy has focused on multilateral dialogue and nuclear disarmament and it has long seen itself as a mediator on the international stage, running down its military after the end of the cold war. It has reintroduced conscription and boosted defence spending since Russia annexed Crimea in 2014, but many on the Swedish left remain suspicious of the US-led Nato’s agenda and argue that Nato membership will only increase regional tensions. Why are they considering joining now? Finland’s prime minister, Sanna Marin, and her Swedish counterpart, Magdalena Andersson, said last month that Russia’s invasion of Ukraine had “changed Europe’s whole security landscape” and “dramatically shaped mindsets” in the Nordic region. Essentially, many Finns and Swedes increasingly feel that joining Nato will help keep them safe when they face a plainly belligerent and unpredictable Russian leader. Polls show public support for Nato membership has trebled to about 75% in Finland and surged to about 60% in Sweden. Nato membership would mean that for the first time Finland and Sweden would have security guarantees from nuclear states. Nato map Would Nato welcome them? Both countries switched from formal neutrality to military non-alignment in 1995 when they joined the EU. They are already Nato partners, taking part in exercises and exchanging intelligence with the alliance. Finland already meets Nato’s defence spending target of 2% of GDP, while Sweden is on course to do so. The Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, has said they would be welcomed “with open arms” if they do apply and that the accession process would be quick, although formal ratification by all the alliance’s members could take several months. From the military perspective, the addition of Finland’s and Sweden’s armed forces would represent a major boost to Nato’s assets in northern Europe, filling a hole in the alliance’s defences by doubling the length of its border with Russia and improving security and stability in the Baltic region. What does Russia have to say? Russia has repeatedly warned Finland and Sweden against joining Nato, saying the “serious military and political consequences” of such a move would oblige it to take “retaliatory steps” to “restore military balance” by strengthening its defences in the Baltic, including by deploying nuclear weapons. Vladimir Putin sees Nato not as a defensive alliance but as a threat to Russia’s security. He blames Nato for blocking his takeover of Ukraine and has demanded Nato troops be withdrawn from eastern Europe. It is unclear how he would respond if he considers the alliance’s expansion in northern Europe an existential danger. What happens next? Finland’s president, prime minister and senior cabinet ministers will meet on Sunday to make a formal decision on submitting an application. A positive decision would then be presented to parliament for approval early next week. Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday at 7am BST Sweden’s ruling Social Democrats have been split on the issue and are holding an internal consultation, with a decision also due on Sunday. The party is widely expected to back membership, giving an overwhelming majority of MPs in favour. Swedish media have said a final government decision will be made on Monday, with a formal application for membership to be submitted shortly afterwards. Many analysts believe the two countries will apply simultaneously.",,,,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9dbace9bdb8147618559c6ceb890315eed335c9a/0_0_3500_2099/master/3500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=ee3c29293629762b8d813933226d3228

Nato allies expect Finland and Sweden to be granted membership quickly, five diplomats and officials told Reuters, paving the way for increased troop presence in the Nordic region during the one-year ratification period.  In the lead-up to their Nato accession, British prime minister Boris Johnson on Wednesday promised to defend Sweden and Finland against potential Russian threats as he travelled to both countries to sign mutual security agreements. In the wider Nordic region, Norway, Denmark and the three Baltic states are already Nato members, and the addition of Finland and Sweden would probably anger Moscow, which says enlargement of the organisation is a direct threat to its own security. 01:33Finland joining Nato would not be 'against anyone', its president says – video Russian president Vladimir Putin has cited the issue as a reason for his actions in Ukraine, which has also expressed a desire to eventually join the alliance. Moscow has also repeatedly warned Finland and Sweden against joining the alliance, threatening “serious military and political consequences”. Asked on Wednesday if Finland would provoke Russia by joining Nato, President Sauli Niinisto said Putin would be to blame. “My response would be that you caused this. Look at the mirror,” Niinisto said. On Thursday European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen warned Russia was the “most direct threat” to the international order because of its “barbaric” war in Ukraine. Von der Leyen and European Council president Charles Michel are in Japan for talks that have touched on Russia’s invasion of Ukraine but also growing concerns about China’s role in Asia and beyond. Russia “is today the most direct threat to the world order with the barbaric war against Ukraine, and its worrying pact with China,” she said after talks with Japanese prime minister Fumio Kishida. On the frontlines, Ukraine on Wednesday said it had pushed back Russian forces in the east and shut gas flows on a route through Russian-held territory, raising the spectre of an energy crisis in Europe. Ukraine’s armed forces’ general staff said it had recaptured Pytomnyk, a village on the main highway north of the second-largest city of Kharkiv, about halfway to the Russian border. Putin’s dilemma: what is his next move in Ukraine?Read more In another village near Kharkiv recaptured by Ukrainian forces in early April, resident Tatyana Pochivalova returned to find her home blasted to ruins. “I have not expected anything like this, such aggression, such destruction,” a weeping Pochivalova said. “I came and I kissed the ground, I simply kissed it. My home, there is nothing. Where am I to live, how am I to live?” The advance appears to be the fastest that Ukraine has mounted since it drove Russian troops away from the capital Kyiv and out of northern Ukraine at the beginning of April. If sustained, it could let Ukrainian forces threaten supply lines for Russia’s main attack force, and put rear logistics targets in Russia itself within range of artillery. However, a senior US military official has warned that neither side can win in the present circumstances and that Russian and Ukrainian forces appear to be settling into a gruelling and deadly stalemate in Ukraine’s east. Despite an announcement from Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, that Ukrainian counter-offensives around the city of Kharkiv were pushing invading Russian forces back, Ukrainian successes appeared to be confined for now to the far north-eastern and south-western flanks of the 300-mile frontline. “The Russians aren’t winning, and the Ukrainians aren’t winning, and we’re at a bit of a stalemate here,” said Lt Gen Scott Berrier, director of the Pentagon’s Defense Intelligence Agency, who gave evidence on Tuesday alongside Avril Haines, the US national intelligence director, to the Senate armed forces committee. The assessment was delivered as the Russian military claimed its forces had advanced as far as the border between the Donetsk and Luhansk regions, potentially edging to securing control of the Donbas region despite losing ground around Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second-largest city. The developments came as Ukraine said it was shutting down Russian gas flows through territory held by Russian-backed separatists – the first time the conflict has directly disrupted shipments to Europe. For its part Moscow has imposed sanctions on the owner of the Polish part of the Yamal pipeline that carries Russian gas to Europe, as well as Gazprom’s former German unit, whose subsidiaries service Europe’s gas consumption. The implications for Europe, which buys more than a third of its gas from Russia, were not immediately clear. Berlin said it was looking into the announcement. An economy ministry spokesperson said the German government was “taking the necessary precautions and preparing for various scenarios”. In southern Ukraine, where Russia has seized a swathe of territory, Kyiv has said Moscow plans to hold a fake referendum on independence or annexation to cement its occupation. Russian forces have also continued to bombard the Azovstal steelworks in the southern port of Mariupol, last bastion of Ukrainian defenders in a city “If there is hell on earth, it is there,” wrote Petro Andryushchenko, an aide to the Mariupol mayor, Vadym Boichenko, who has left the city. Ukraine says it is likely that tens of thousands of people have been killed in Mariupol. Ukrainian authorities say between 150,000 and 170,000 of the city’s 400,000 residents are still living there amid the Russian-occupied ruins. With Reuters",,,,

His remarks came as a Swedish parliamentary security review said membership would reduce the risk of conflict in northern Europe and a day after neighbouring Finland said it aimed to join the alliance.  Finland and Sweden, while both Nato partners, have long viewed membership as an unnecessary provocation of Russia, their powerful eastern neighbour. Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine, however, has led to a radical rethink of their security policies. Membership of Nato would require ratification by all existing members, and Erdoğan remarked to journalists after leaving Friday prayers in Istanbul that Turkey would not welcome either. “We are currently following developments regarding Sweden and Finland, but we don’t feel positively about this,” he said. Turkey has been a Nato member since 1952 and its membership remains a cornerstone of its foreign policy towards western countries. The comments appeared directed at the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK), which Turkey regards as a terrorist organisation, although they appeared to encompass the communities of Kurdish origin in Scandinavia as a whole. “We don’t want to commit a mistake,” he added. “Scandinavian countries are like guesthouses for terrorist organisations. To go even further, they have seats in their parliaments, too.” Sweden has a large Kurdish diaspora, and prominent Swedish citizens of Kurdish origin currently include six members of parliament. The Turkish authorities have not provided any evidence for claims that the parliamentarians have links with the PKK or similar groups outside Sweden. The Kurdish-speaking population of Finland was estimated at just over 15,000 people as of 2020, less than 0.3% of the population. Finland’s foreign minister, Pekka Haavisto, on Friday urged patience and called for a gradual approach in response to Turkey. “We need some patience in this type of process, it’s not happening in one day … Let’s take issues step by step,” he told reporters. Finland’s prime minister, Sanna Marin, and president, Sauli Niinistö, on Thursday said the country “must apply for Nato membership without delay”. Government confirmation of the decision is expected on Sunday, with parliamentary assent likely early next week. Sweden’s ruling Social Democrats will also decide whether to formally approve joining Nato on Sunday and are widely expected to drop decades of opposition to membership. Parliament will debate security issues on Monday. The security review published on Friday did not make a recommendation, but said developing defence alliances outside existing structures was not realistic. “Swedish Nato membership would raise the threshold for military conflicts and thus have a conflict-preventing effect in northern Europe,” said the country’s foreign minister, Ann Linde, presenting the report’s conclusions. “The most important consequence of Swedish membership would be that Sweden would be a part of Nato’s collective security and included in security guarantees according to article 5 [of the alliance’s founding treaty],” she said. Article 5, the cornerstone of the US-led defensive alliance, states that an attack on one Nato member is an attack on all and commits its current 30 members to defend each other in the event of armed aggression. The Swedish report, due to be debated in parliament on Monday, noted that “within the framework of current cooperation, there is no guarantee that Sweden would be helped if it were the target of a serious threat or attack”. The Expressen daily has reported that a special cabinet meeting will be called after Monday’s parliamentary debate, with the prime minister, Magdalena Andersson, likely to send Sweden’s membership application to Nato by the end of the day. Not all the ruling Social Democrats’ party members are automatically in favour. “I think everybody would have wanted more time for this, because it’s a huge issue,” Stefan Löfven, the prime minister from 2014 to 2021, told Agence France-Presse. Moscow has previously warned that Finnish and Swedish Nato membership would force it to “restore balance” by strengthening its defences in the Baltic, including by deploying nuclear weapons in Kaliningrad, between Poland and Lithuania. Linde noted that Finnish and Swedish Nato membership would be considered “negative” by Russia. She said neither country expected a “conventional military attack” in reaction but added that “an armed assault cannot be ruled out”. Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BST The Swedish defence minister, Peter Hultqvist, said on Friday: “If Sweden chooses to seek Nato membership, there is a risk of a reaction from Russia. Let me state that, in such a case, we are prepared to deal with any counter-response.” Public support for Nato membership in Finland, which shares an 810-mile (1,300km) border with Russia, has more than trebled to about 76% since Russia’s onslaught on Ukraine, and has risen to about 60% in Sweden.

Ukrainian military forces released footage on Thursday that they say shows destroyed Russian military vehicles and a pontoon bridge in eastern Ukraine. According to the Ukrainian forces, the images were taken along the Siverskyi Donets River.
The first war crimes trial since Vladimir Putin ordered the invasion of Ukraine has opened in Kyiv in a watershed moment. Vadim Shysimarin, a 21-year-old Russian commander of the Kantemirovskaya tank division, allegedly killed a civilian on 28 February in the village of Chupakhivka while fighting in the Sumy region in north-east Ukraine.
Russia’s defence ministry has claimed its forces struck the Kremenchug oil refinery in central Ukraine, destroying its production capacity and fuel tanks.
Ukraine says it has damaged a Russian navy logistics ship near Snake Island, a small but strategic outpost in the Black Sea.
Kharkiv governor Oleh Synyehubov said “the night was relatively calm” in the region. However he added that in Dergachi “the Russians damaged the humanitarian headquarters, the registry office, part of the clinic, and the ambulance building”, and that in Shebelinka “a Russian shell hit a hangar building. The roof of the hangar and 10 trucks were on fire. Unfortunately, three people died and five others were injured.”
The Ukrainian counteroffensive around the north-eastern city of Kharkiv is “starting to look very similar to the counteroffensive that ultimately drove Russian troops away from Kyiv and out of western Ukraine entirely”, the Institute for the Study of War has said in its latest assessment of the conflict.
Swedish membership of Nato would have a stabilising effect and would benefit countries around the Baltic sea, Sweden’s foreign minister Ann Linde said on Friday, a day after neighbour Finland announced it was in favour of applying to join the 30-nation alliance.
The EU’s top diplomat, Josep Borrell, has said that the European Union would provide another €500m (£425m) worth of military support to Ukraine, and that he was confident a deal could be reached in the coming days to agree an embargo on Russian oil.
British foreign secretary Liz Truss said it was vital to keep up the pressure on Russia by supplying more weapons to Ukraine and imposing further sanctions. “It is very important at this time that we keep up the pressure on Vladimir Putin by supplying more weapons to Ukraine and by increasing the sanctions.”

The Kremlin’s press service said in a statement that Vladimir Putin told Sauli Niinistö that Finland’s abandonment “of its traditional policy of military neutrality would be an error since there are no threats to Finland’s security”.  The statement added: “Such a change in the country’s foreign policy could negatively affect Russian-Finnish relations, which had been built in the spirit of good neighbourliness and partnership for many years, and were mutually beneficial.” The response came after Niinistö told Putin in a phone conversation that the militarily non-aligned Nordic country, which has a complex history with its eastern neighbour, “will decide to apply for Nato membership in the coming days”. Niinistö’s office said the Finnish head of state told Putin how starkly Finland’s security environment had changed after Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine, and pointed to Russia’s demands on Finland refraining from seeking membership of the 30-member western military alliance. Why are Sweden and Finland not yet in Nato and does the alliance want them?Read more “The discussion [with Putin] was straightforward and unambiguous and was held without exaggeration. Avoiding tensions was considered important,” said Niinistö, Finland’s president since 2012 and one of a handful of western leaders who has been in regular dialogue with Putin over the past decade. Niinistö said he had already told Putin at their first meeting in 2012 that “each independent nation would maximise its own security”. “That is still the case. By joining Nato, Finland will strengthen its own security and assume its responsibilities. It is not something away from anybody,” Niinistö said. He stressed that Finland, despite its probable future Nato membership, wanted to continue dealing with Russia bilaterally in “practical issues generated by the border neighbourhood” and hoped to engage with Moscow “in a professional manner”. According to the Kremlin statement, the two leaders also discussed Russia’s military operation in Ukraine, and the possibility of achieving a political solution. Putin said negotiations between Moscow and Kyiv had been suspended due to Ukraine’s “lack of interest in a serious and constructive dialogue”. The phone call was conducted on Finland’s initiative, Niinistö’s office said. Finland shares a 830-mile (1,340km) border with Russia, the longest of any EU member. Niinistö and the Finnish prime minister, Sanna Marin, on Thursday jointly endorsed Finland’s Nato bid and recommended the country must apply for it “without delay” to guarantee security amid Russia’s military manoeuvres in Ukraine and Europe’s changed geopolitical and security landscape. A formal announcement from Niinistö and Marin of Finland’s intention to apply for membership is expected on Sunday. Marin’s governing Social Democratic party approved the application on Saturday, paving the way for a parliamentary vote next week to endorse the move. It is expected to pass with overwhelming support. A formal membership application would then be submitted to Nato headquarters in Brussels. Neighbouring Sweden is expected to decide on its stance on Sunday in a meeting of the governing Social Democratic party led by the prime minister, Magdalena Andersson. The US president, Joe Biden, held a joint call on Friday with Niinistö and Andersson where, according to a White House statement, he “underscored his support for Nato’s open door policy and for the right of Finland and Sweden to decide their own future, foreign policy and security arrangements”.",,,,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eb3f031a4c74dc6aa149dd1fc8738d8164195457/0_289_4875_2925/master/4875.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=7d37202c84d42e0d08fefb486c79f8af

Hundreds of Ukrainian fighters, including wounded men carried out on stretchers, left the vast steel plant in Mariupol where they had mounted a dogged last stand and turned themselves over to Russian hands.  More than 260 fighters left the Azovstal plant — their last redoubt in the southern port city — on Monday and were transported to two towns controlled by Moscow-backed separatists, officials on both sides said. Other fighters — their precise numbers unknown — remain inside the ruins of the fortified mill that sprawls over 4 square mile in the otherwise now Russian-held city. A screengrab taken from a video released by the Russian defence ministry shows Ukrainian soldiers leaving the Azovstal steel plant on Tuesday. Photograph: Anadolu Agency/Getty Images Azovstal’s fall marks the complete capture of Mariupol, a significant milestone in one of the bloodiest battles of the war. Mariupol, February 2022 Mariupol advance steelworks satellite Footage published over the weekend showed the steelworks being bombarded. Steelworks attack Wrapping up Mariupol’s capture would give Russia an unbroken land bridge to the Crimean Peninsula, which it annexed from Ukraine in 2014, and also deprives Ukraine of a vital port. It could also free up Russian forces for fighting elsewhere in the industrial heartland of eastern Ukraine. Severodonetsk Fighting is increasingly focusing on the Severodonetsk, the easternmost city still held by Ukrainian forces after more than 11 weeks of war, and an a effort to complete a wider encirclement of Ukraine’s defending forces in the Donbas appears to have failed. A smaller-scale encirclement of Severodonetsk also failed last week after Russian forces were defeated with heavy losses in a series of unsuccessful attempts to cross the Siverskyi Donets River at Bilohorivka. Aftermath of failed attempt by Russian soldiers to cross the Siverskyi Donets River. The river is increasingly becoming a dividing line between the two sides in the Donbas – the name given collectively to the Donetsk and Luhansk regions – and around Kharkiv to the north. What happened in first three weeks of the invasion?  How did we get here? In the months before its invasion, Russia deployed hundreds of tanks, self-propelled artillery and short-range ballistic missiles from as far away as Siberia to within striking range of Ukraine. Map showing Russian troop deployments Moscow’s rhetoric grew more belligerent. Putin demanded legal guarantees that Ukraine would never join Nato or host its missile strike systems, concessions he was unlikely to receive. A flurry of diplomatic activity did little to ease tensions. The second half of February was long considered the most likely period for a potential offensive. Russian soldiers stayed on in Belarus beyond the end of planned military exercises, and the Winter Olympics, hosted by Russia’s ally China, concluded. The invasion was preceded on 22 February by Putin saying Russia would recognise the territorial claims of self-proclaimed republics in Luhansk and Donetsk. He had already ordered his forces into Russian-controlled territory in Ukraine. Donbas map What do we know about Russia’s deployments? Scores of battalion tactical groups – the smallest operational unit in Russia’s army, consisting of about 800-1,000 troops – were put in place near the borders of Ukraine in Russia and Belarus before the invasion. As of 18 February, the US estimated that Russia had 169,000-190,000 personnel in and around Ukraine. Map An estimated 32,000 separatist forces were already operating in the breakaway areas in Donetsk and Luhansk – some of whom were likely to be unacknowledged Russian forces – before the invasion. Many of the heavy weapons stationed near Ukraine arrived as far back as spring 2021. Over the new year Russia also began to move tanks, artillery, air-defence systems and fighter jets to Belarus for joint exercises in February. That deployment then grew.

Map and satellite images showing deployment of Russian troops How do the militaries compare? Russia’s invasion pits the Kremlin’s large, recently modernised military against an adversary largely using older versions of the same or similar equipment, dating back to the Soviet era. Russia has significant numerical advantages on land, and in particular in the air and at sea, although Ukrainians are defending their homeland. Armies compared What is the historical context? In 2014 Putin sent troops to annex Crimea, a mainly Russian-speaking region of Ukraine. Russia also incited a separatist uprising in Ukraine’s south-east, clandestinely sending soldiers and weapons to provoke a conflict that grew into a full-blown war. A 2015 peace deal established a line of demarcation and called on both sides to make concessions. After that, low-level fighting continued along the front, and each side accused the other of violating the agreement. Historical map Going back further, Russia has long opposed any attempts by Ukraine to move towards the EU and Nato. One of Putin’s oft-repeated demands was a guarantee that Ukraine would never join Nato, the alliance of 30 countries that has expanded eastwards since the end of the cold war. Nato map What was the role of Nord Stream 2? On 22 February, the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, stopped the certification process for the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline in response to Russia’s recognition of the two self-proclaimed republics. First announced in 2015, the $11bn (£8.3bn) pipeline owned by Russia’s state-backed energy firm Gazprom was built to carry gas from western Siberia to Lubmin in Germany’s north-east, doubling the existing capacity of the Nord Stream 1 pipeline and keeping 26m German homes warm at an affordable price.

Abandoning decades of military non-alignment, the two countries’ governments will present their proposals to their respective parliaments on Monday and are expected to formally submit a joint membership application to the 30-member alliance as soon as the decisions are ratified.  “The president and the government’s foreign policy committee have agreed that after consulting parliament, Finland will apply for Nato membership,” president Sauli Niinistö said, hailing the decision as “a historic day” for the Nordic country. “A new era is opening,” Niinistö said. “A protected Finland is being born as part of a stable, strong and responsible Nordic region. We gain security, and we also share it. It’s good to keep in mind that security isn’t a zero-sum game.” Finland’s prime minister, Sanna Marin, said she hoped parliament would confirm the decision “in the coming days”, adding that as a member of Nato, Finland would help reinforce not just the 30-member, US-led defensive alliance but also “strengthen the EU, whose voice in Nato can become stronger”. A few hours later, Sweden’s Social Democrats said they had jettisoned their previous opposition to Nato membership, with Moscow’s onslaught on Ukraine looking set to usher in the very expansion of Nato Vladimir Putin claimed he wanted to prevent. “The best thing for the security of Sweden and the Swedish people is to join Nato,” the prime minister, Magdalena Andersson, told a news conference. “We believe Sweden needs the formal security guarantees that come with membership in Nato.” She said non-alignment had served Sweden well but “will not do so in the future”. Sweden would be “vulnerable” as the only country in the Baltic region outside Nato, she said, adding that Stockholm hoped to submit a joint application with Helsinki. “Tomorrow I will assure broad parliamentary support in the Riksdag for a Swedish membership application,” Andersson said. The issue has divided her party, with some members objecting that the decision was rushed through. The Social Democrats remain opposed to nuclear weapons or permanent Nato military bases on Swedish soil. Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BST The two Nordic countries’ announcements came as western agencies reported that Russia had suffered heavy military losses in Ukraine and risked getting further bogged down in the strategically important east of the country amid stiff resistance. Finland shares an 810-mile (1,300km) border with Russia and, like Sweden, has maintained strict policies of neutrality then non-alignment since the end of the second world war, viewing Nato membership as a provocation of Moscow. However, Putin’s invasion of Ukraine on 24 February has led to a profound change in both countries’ thinking, with public support for Nato accession in Finland trebling to about 75% and surging to between 50% and 60% in Sweden. Russia has repeatedly warned both countries against joining Nato, saying such a move would oblige it to “restore military balance” by strengthening its defences in the Baltic Sea region, including by deploying nuclear weapons. Niinistö called his Russian counterpart, Putin, on Saturday and informed him that his country aimed to join Nato, in a conversation he described as “direct and straightforward” but also “calm and cool … The surprise was he took it so calmly.” Putin reportedly responded to Niinistö’s call by saying Nato membership “would be a mistake, since there is no threat to Finland’s security”, according to a readout of the call released by the Kremlin, but did not issue any retaliatory threats. Niinistö said on Sunday that he did not believe Russia would respond to the move with military force, but added: “Total vigilance is in place.” Nato’s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, has repeatedly said both countries would be “welcomed with open arms” and that the accession process would be quick, though formal approval by all the alliance’s members could take several months. However, Turkey has expressed dissatisfaction over Finnish and Swedish membership, which requires the unanimous approval of the alliance’s members. The Turkish foreign minister said on Sunday that Sweden and Finland must stop supporting terrorist groups in their countries and provide clear security guarantees. Speaking after a Nato foreign ministers’ meeting in Berlin, Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu said he had met his Swedish and Finnish counterparts and they were seeking to address Turkey’s concerns, adding that Turkey was “not threatening anybody” but that while Finland’s approach was conciliatory, Sweden was not being so constructive. “There absolutely needs to be security guarantees here. They need to stop supporting terrorist organisations,” Çavuşoğlu said. Ankara is particularly concerned about Sweden’s support for the PKK Kurdish militant group, designated a terrorist group by Turkey, the EU and the US. Niinistö said he was ready to meet the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, to discuss his objections, while Stoltenberg said Turkey was not blocking the membership bids and he was confident Ankara’s concerns would be resolved. “Turkey made it clear that its intention is not to block membership,” the Nato secretary general said. “I am confident we’ll be able to find common ground.” Ukraine map On the battlefield in Ukraine, the frontlines shifted as Russia made advances in the fiercely contested eastern Donbas region and Ukraine’s forces waged a successful counter-offensive near the strategic Russian-held city of Izium. Near the north-eastern city of Kharkiv, where Ukrainian forces have been on the attack since early this month, local commanders said they believed Russia was withdrawing troops to reinforce positions around Izium to the south. Russia’s defence ministry claimed to have carried out “high-precision” missile strikes on four artillery munitions depots in the Donetsk area, also destroying two missile-launching systems and radar and taking out 15 Ukrainian drones. But British military intelligence said in an update that Russia’s offensive in the Donbas had “lost momentum”. Demoralised Russian troops had failed to make substantial gains and Moscow’s battle plan was “significantly behind schedule”, it said. “Russia has now likely suffered losses of one-third of the ground combat force it committed in February”, it said. “Under current conditions, Russia is unlikely to dramatically accelerate its rate of advance over the next 30 days.” Ukraine’s military acknowledged setbacks, however, saying on Sunday that despite losses, “Russian forces continue to advance in the Lyman, Sievierodonetsk, Avdiivka and Kurakhiv areas in the broader Donbas region”.",,,,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fbfb11edafa9b4c3d744f99b0f5804b0950e97f2/0_200_5120_3074/master/5120.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=0ce1b93526ab25699e5c1f4a4f5eaa22

Photograph: Ukrainian Presidential Press Service/Reuters,UK prime minister Boris Johnson and Ukraine's president Volodymyr Zelenskiy in Kyiv,"Sunday, 15 May 2022",2022-05-15,Boris Johnson is using Ukraine crisis to launch a British comeback in Europe,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/may/15/boris-johnson-ukraine-crisis-british-comeback-europe,"Oh the irony! Boris Johnson, the Brexit ringleader who turned his back on the EU, now boldly leads the defence of Europe in the face of Russian aggression. An exaggeration? Yes, but behind the hype lies an intriguing story. Even as he risks another major rift with Brussels over Northern Ireland, Johnson is using the Ukraine crisis to mend fences with some old European allies. His aim: to re-establish the UK as a continental power. The signing last week of bilateral defence pacts with Nato aspirants Sweden and Finland – “our friends in the north” – was the latest manifestation of an apparently concerted British drive to revive political ties with eastern and central European and Nordic countries that were natural UK allies before the Brexit rupture. Johnson and senior ministers have repeatedly visited Poland and the Baltic republics as the Ukraine crisis has unfolded.  Britain’s rapid deployment of extra troops and equipment along Nato’s “front line” with Russia, and this month’s pledge of an additional $1.6bn in sophisticated weaponry and aid to Ukraine itself, has been praised by regional governments and Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, who hosted Johnson last month. In sharp contrast, the EU’s “top two”, France’s Emmanuel Macron and Germany’s Olaf Scholz, have yet to visit wartime Kyiv. Central to British pushback in Europe is the Joint Expeditionary Force, a Nato-aligned, non-EU military grouping embracing the UK, Norway, Denmark, Finland, Sweden, Iceland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, and the Netherlands. The JEF is deeply involved in Ukraine-related defence. Seen one way, it’s the “European army” the EU often talks about but never manages to organise – and it’s led by Britain. Before Ukraine erupted, Hungary’s hard-right leader Viktor Orban was welcomed at Downing Street. Photograph: Bernadett Szabó/Reuters Johnson is undoubtedly sincere in prioritising Russia’s defeat. For him, the war symbolises the global struggle between democracy and authoritarianism. In this, he sticks close to the US, Nato’s leader and post-Brexit Britain’s essential ally, without whose agreement he dares do little. Yet competing with France and Germany for power and influence in Europe, and challenging the grand panjandrums of Brussels, at a time of profound geopolitical upheaval is for him a very different matter – and a potentially politically rewarding pursuit. Before Ukraine erupted, Johnson was already courting rightwing governments in Warsaw and Budapest which, like Britain, are fighting running battles with the EU. Viktor Orbán, Hungary’s hard-right leader, who is blocking oil sanctions on Russia, was warmly welcomed in Downing Street last year. Britain’s wooing of Europe’s eastern and northern flanks dates from the period between 1995 and 2004, when numerous EU applicants were backed by London to offset and weaken the dominant France-Germany-Benelux axis. Since then, Paris has mostly opposed further EU enlargement. Macron warned Ukraine last week that it could wait decades for full membership. Johnson’s more positive Ukraine activism is favourably compared, in London, Washington and parts of eastern Europe, with perceived hesitancy, division and weakness at the heart of the EU. Germany’s Scholz, clinging to the wreckage of Ostpolitik, has become synonymous with foot-dragging. Despite belatedly agreeing to supply heavy weapons and ban oil imports, he has left Germans distinctly underwhelmed, if his party’s Schleswig-Holstein state election flop is any guide. Fresh from winning a second presidential term, and observing Berlin’s travails, Macron now seems to think he’s boss of Europe. But on the continent’s most urgent issue, the reality is different. The value of French military assistance to Kyiv ($105m) is less than half of tiny Estonia’s ($220m). Macron’s vainglorious pre-war “phone diplomacy” with Putin badly backfired – in truth, he was played. And France’s EU presidency is still struggling to agree energy sanctions. More broadly, Macron’s cherished plans to create a “strategically autonomous” Europe, independent of the US (and China), have shattered into pieces amid the Ukraine maelstrom. In 2019, he declared Nato “brain dead”, a reckless claim that, with hindsight, may have helped convince Putin it really was. Now, in a few frantic months, a rejuvenated Nato, buoyed by multibillion-dollar US arms packages and with Britain to the fore, has saved Europe’s as well as Kyiv’s figurative bacon. Naturally, the EU does not agree. Brussels reckons it’s doing a fine job and on refugees, for example, it is – unlike Priti Patel’s Home Office. In truth, everyone could and should be doing more. Liz Truss risks recklessly inflaming Ukraine’s war to serve her own ambition | Simon JenkinsRead more Yet the uncomfortably brutal bottom line is this: were it not for the swift, courageous and generous commitments made by the US and UK, plus anglosphere countries such as Canada and Australia, Ukraine might well have lost the war by now, free democratic Europe would be in headlong retreat, and Putin could be eyeing his next victim while keeping Macron on hold. Huge, uncertain shifts in relative power balances across Europe are now in train as a consequence of the war. The EU, under strong internal pressure to reform from its own “Conference on the Future of Europe”, which reported last week, faces big questions about relevance, cohesion and decision-making. French and German leaders badly need to forge a shared vision. The US has re-engaged in Europe – but for how long? As for the UK, recent events have surely reminded the most recalcitrant Brexiters that Europe is Britain’s home turf, the inescapable neighbourhood where primary national interests lie. Less is heard, thankfully, about “global Britain’s” Asia-Pacific tilt or US free trade nirvana. Ukraine gave isolated Johnson an opportunity and, true to form, he seized it. But never underestimate his ability, and that of his attention-seeking foreign secretary, Liz Truss, to throw it all away. Suspending aspects of the Northern Ireland protocol and abrogating the Brexit treaty, as they threaten to do this week, is one sure way to unite Europe against Britain – again – and wreck the anti-Putin alliance.",/p/ye5kk,644.0,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/may/15/boris-johnson-ukraine-crisis-british-comeback-europe#comments,

The evacuation of wounded Ukrainian troops from the Azovstal steelworks in Mariupol is under way, Volodomyr Zelenskiy confirmed, with more than 260 fighters transported out of the plant. The troops have fulfilled their combat mission, the general staff of the armed forces said. Ukraine’s deputy defense minister has said an “exchange procedure will take place” to bring evacuees home.
Ukraine’s Joint Forces Task Force said on Monday that 20 civilians, including a child, were killed in Russian shelling in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions.
Western military sources say that Vladimir Putin is involved in the war in Ukraine “at the level of a colonel or brigadier”. The Russian leader is reportedly so personally involved he is helping determine the movement of forces in the Donbas.
Ukrainian officials claimed that troops counter-attacking against Russian forces in the country’s north-east had pushed them back from the city of Kharkiv and advanced as far as the border with Russia.
Russian forces have shelled frontline positions in Ukraine’s eastern Donbas area as fighting becomes increasingly focused on Severodonetsk, the easternmost city still held by Ukrainian forces after more than 11 weeks of war.
After Sweden and Finland yesterday confirmed plans to join Nato, Sweden is seeking to quell Turkish opposition by sending diplomats to the country. Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan has said Turkey will not approve the bids, and that delegations from the countries should not bother coming.
Vladimir Putin said Russia had no issue with Finland and Sweden, but that the expansion of military infrastructure on their territory would demand a reaction from Moscow, as the Nordic countries move closer to joining Nato, which Russia has branded a mistake with far-reaching consequences.
Hungary has been accused of “holding the EU hostage” over its refusal to agree an oil embargo against Russia, as the bloc struggles to reach consensus on its latest sanctions aimed at eroding the Kremlin’s ability to wage war.
American fast-food giant McDonald’s will exit the Russian market and sell its business in the increasingly isolated country, the company said on Monday. Meanwhile, the Moscow city government is to take over a factory belonging to the French carmaker Renault and use it to revive the Soviet-era Moskvitch in Russia’s first major nationalization of a foreign company during its war in Ukraine.

Civilians trapped with the soldiers were evacuated earlier this month. Despite calls for action by pro-Ukrainian protesters in some parts of Europe in recent days, hope that some sort of Ukrainian special forces rescue mission could be mounted to save the troops besieged in the huge factory have proved entirely unrealistic. The soldiers there are understood to number around 600, according to Reuters.It’s not known if a ceasefire to evacuate the wounded is the beginning of the end of the siege of the Azovstal plant and the final domino going down in Mariupol.We await more news.

According to media reports, the company’s Russian assets were sold for one rouble, meaning the city of Moscow has effectively taken control of the factory free.Renault’s CEO, Luca de Meo, said in statement that the company was protecting its future business in Russia.Today we have taken a difficult but necessary decision, and we are making a responsible choice towards our 45,000 employees in Russia while preserving the group’s performance and our ability to return to the country in the future.Hawkish commentators such as the head of Russia Today, Margarita Simonyan, have said foreign companies that leave the Russian market should have their local assets seized. Moscow’s mayor, Sergei Sobyanin, appeared to defend Renault’s decision and said the city would take over the factory to prevent unemployment.Sobyanin said:The foreign owner decided to close the Moscow Renault plant. This is its right, but we cannot allow thousands of workers to be left without work. Therefore, I decided to take the plant under control of the city and resume the production of passenger cars under the historical Moskvitch brand.

Recep Tayyip Erdoğan said diplomatic delegations from the two countries, which have reversed decades of military non-alignment in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, should not even bother coming to Ankara to discuss the move.  “We will not say yes to those [countries] that apply sanctions to Turkey to join the security organisation Nato,” Erdoğan said. “They say they will come to Turkey on Monday. Will they come to persuade us? Excuse us, but they shouldn’t bother.” The Turkish president’s comments came as Sweden’s prime minister, Magdalena Andersson, said “a broad majority” in parliament backed Nato membership as “the best thing for the security of Sweden” – drawing a warning from Moscow. Sweden was “leaving one era behind us and entering a new one”, she said. The Finnish government confirmed its intention to join Nato on Sunday, shortly before Andersson’s ruling Social Democrats abandoned 73 years of opposition to the idea. Andersson said Sweden’s Nato ambassador would formally hand over Stockholm’s application to the alliance headquarters in Brussels “within the next few days” and that the membership request would be submitted simultaneously with Finland’s. Ankara first raised objections to Finnish and Swedish membership on Friday, citing their history of hosting members of Kurdish militant groups and Sweden’s suspension of arms sales to Turkey since 2019 over Ankara’s military operation in Syria. The justice ministry said on Monday that over the past five years the two countries had failed to respond positively to extradition requests for 33 people Turkey says are linked to groups it deems terrorist, namely the Kurdistan Workers’ party (PKK) and followers of Fethullah Gülen. Nato would become “a hatchery” for terrorists if the two countries joined, Erdoğan told a news conference on Monday. Nato Europe mapNato Europe map The UK’s foreign secretary, Liz Truss, said on Monday night that she “strongly supports” Finland and Sweden joining Nato, adding that the countries should be integrated into the alliance “as soon as possible”, to “strengthen the collective security of Europe”. The Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, has repeatedly said the two Nordic countries would be “welcomed with open arms”, but the process requires unanimity among the alliance’s 30 existing members. Turkey’s objections, even if aimed at extracting concessions, could delay the process. The Swedish defence minister, Peter Hultqvist, said on Monday that Stockholm was working hard to overcome Ankara’s reservations, while the foreign ministry said the Swedish and Finnish foreign ministers, Ann Linde and Pekka Haavisto, would travel “soon” to Turkey for talks. “I’m confident we will be able to address the concerns Turkey has expressed in a way that doesn’t delay the membership,” Stoltenberg said on Sunday. Andersson told reporters after Monday’s three-hour parliamentary debate that Sweden would be “in a vulnerable position” while the application was processed, but that ministers saw no direct military threat from Russia at present. Stockholm had received security assurances from key partners, including the US, Britain, Germany, France, she said, and on Monday Denmark, Norway and Iceland also pledged support, saying they would “assist Finland and Sweden by all means necessary” if they were attacked before obtaining Nato membership. However, the government warned of possible “disinformation and attempts to scare and divide us”, Andersson said, adding that if its application was approved, Sweden would not want permanent Nato military bases or nuclear weapons on its territory. Sanna Marin speaks during the debate in the Finnish parliament in Helsinki. Photograph: Lehtikuva/Reuters Russia’s deputy foreign minister, Sergei Ryabkov, said the countries “should have no illusions that we will simply put up with it”, calling the move “another grave mistake with far-reaching consequences” and warning that the “general level of military tension will increase”. However, the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, later appeared to row back somewhat, and said Moscow did not see Finnish and Swedish Nato membership as a direct threat in itself. “Russia has no problem with these states – none,” Putin said. “And so in this sense there is no immediate threat to Russia from an expansion of Nato to include these countries,” he said. He warned, however, that deployment of military infrastructure on their territories “would certainly provoke our response”. Russia has previously advised both countries against joining Nato, saying such a move would oblige it to “restore military balance” by strengthening its defences in the Baltic Sea region, including by deploying nuclear weapons. Finland shares an 810-mile (1,300km) land border with Russia, and Sweden a maritime border. Both countries have for decades considered that joining the 30-member, US-led Nato alliance would represent an unnecessary provocation of Moscow. However, Putin’s invasion of Ukraine on 24 February has led to a profound change in thinking, with public support for Nato accession in Finland more than trebling to about 75% and rising to between 50% and 60% in Sweden.

On Wednesday, he also extended his demands from the two he outlined on Monday to 10, leading to claims that he is using blackmail.  At his press conference on Monday, he made two key demands: that Finland and Sweden end their supposed support for the Kurdish Workers’ party (PKK), which Turkey regards as a terrorist organisation, and that they lift their ban on arms exports imposed in October 2019 after the Turkish incursion in northern Syria. Turkey blocks early vote on Sweden and Finland joining NatoRead more No one doubts that Erdoğan’s intervention could tangle Nato up in knots for months. It is now the task of alliance diplomats to establish Erdoğan’s seriousness and the price that would have to be paid to make him back down, and prevent a full-blown Nato crisis. The Swedish foreign minister, Ann Linde, initially hoped that something had got lost in translation after she had been quoted in the Turkish press saying the Turks regard all Kurds as terrorists. Linde said on Sunday she had never made these remarks, had never met the PKK, and would not do so. She was cautiously optimistic that any misunderstanding could be cleared up, but by Wednesday it was clear her reassurances were falling short of what Erdoğan requires. 01:11'Don't bother': Erdoğan says Turkey will not approve Sweden and Finland joining Nato – video The Nordic political class initially appeared sceptical about Erdoğan’s seriousness. Finland’s president, Sauli Niinistö, said he spoke with Erdoğan a month ago and none of his current concerns were aired. It was also being said that no early warning flares were sent up by Turkey’s Nato ambassador, Basat Öztürk. But that assessment is changing. Jonathan Eyal, the associate director of the Rusi thinktank, said Erdoğan “lives on the edge and operates through brinkmanship”. Eyal added: “Many of his demands about the PKK are part of a familiar Turkish tune. But he has domestic reasons to be standing up to America. The economy is in tatters and his popularity is at an all time low.” With inflation at 66.9% and facing elections next summer, there is no harm galvanising the nationalist vote, but that is not to say Erdoğan’s complaints are entirely synthetic. Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BST On Monday, the Turkish justice ministry identified six alleged PKK members it is seeking to extradite from Finland and 11 from Sweden. Add in people accused by Turkey of supporting the US-based cleric Fethullah Gülen, who Ankara accuses of orchestrating the 2016 coup attempt, and Turkey wants 12 people returned from Finland and 21 from Sweden. Nordic diplomats say this list was last presented in 2017 and has not been the subject of any Turkish lobbying in recent years. Turkish media has reported what it describes as other examples of a “soft” Swedish attitude to terrorism, including evidence that the Syrian branch of the PKK has held meetings in Stockholm hosted by the Swedish foreign office and the Olof Palme International Center, a thinktank funded by Swedish trade unions. Turkey also says that in 2019 PKK supporters held a protest in a shopping centre in support of the jailed leader Abdullah Öcalan and Swedish security forces did nothing to prevent them from carrying the PKK’s “flag” and pictures of Öcalan. Eyal said it would be hard for the Nordic countries to bow to these complaints. Erdoğan: Turkey ‘not positive’ about Sweden and Finland joining NatoRead more “It is not possible for either country … to change its domestic legislation on freedom of assembly,” he said. “Sweden in particular has an active Kurdish community that has political support. This episode is reminiscent of 2009 when Erdoğan said he would not allow Anders Rasmussen to be appointed Nato’s secretary general unless Denmark closed a Kurdish TV station. Rasmussen was appointed but a year later the TV station was closed.” Some similar delayed behind-the-scenes deal could happen this time. Neither country can simply tear up its own internal asylum systems and Sweden says it does do not run independent terrorist lists different from those compiled at EU level. Eyal argues Erdoğan’s target is as likely to be the US as Finland and Sweden. Turkey’s 2017 purchase of Russia’s S-400 missile defence system turned it into a pariah in the US and led to Ankara being kicked out of the F-35 stealth fighter jet programme. The recent rumours, denied by Moscow, that Vladimir Putin might visit Ankara in the near future were probably another signal from Ankara that it has cards to play. But it is precisely this double game that leaves so many other Nato states frustrated with Erdoğan’s brinkmanship.",,,,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ed002f6def62db8ae0ad3199e97b24c3c108b730/0_391_3128_1878/master/3128.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=d52ef2fbc8634cdeceee3950b25a052f

The Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, accepted the two historically non-aligned Nordic countries’ membership requests, each in a white folder embossed with their national flag, at the US-led defensive alliance’s HQ in Brussels on Wednesday.  “I warmly welcome the requests by Finland and Sweden to join Nato. You are our closest partners,” Stoltenberg told the two countries’ ambassadors, hailing the occasion as “a historic step” and “a good day at a critical time for our safety”. Jens Stoltenberg (left) shakes hands with Sweden’s ambassador to Nato, Axel Wernhoff, in Brussels on Wednesday. Photograph: Johanna Geron/EPA However, multiple reports cited diplomatic sources as saying Turkey later blocked a vote by Nato ambassadors on opening talks immediately, suggesting the first stage of the accession process may take longer than the two weeks the alliance planned. The enlargement of Nato must be approved by all 30 members and then ratified by their parliaments, which could take up to a year. The alliance has said it wants to move as fast as possible given the potential Russian threat to Finland and Sweden. The two countries’ applications represent a radical redrawing of Europe’s security landscape in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and, if successful, would represent the most significant expansion of Nato in decades, doubling the alliance’s border with Russia. Finland and Sweden may join Nato – but even they can’t guarantee that will make them safer | Thomas MeaneyRead more Stoltenberg said Nato would “take into account the security interests” of all members and was “determined to work through the issues and reach rapid conclusions”. All allies agreed on the importance of enlargement, he said, adding: “We all agree we must stand together and that this is an historic moment we must seize.” In Ankara, however, President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan told MPs from his AK party the alliance must respect Turkey’s reservations. “Nato expansion is only meaningful for us in proportion to the respect that will be shown to our sensitivities,” he said. Turkey accuses Sweden and Finland of harbouring members of Kurdish militant groups it considers terrorist organisations, and also objects to their decisions in 2019 to ban arms exports to Ankara over Turkey’s military operations in Syria. 01:11'Don't bother': Erdoğan says Turkey will not approve Sweden and Finland joining Nato – video Erdoğan accused Stockholm in particular of providing safe haven to members of the outlawed Kurdistan Workers’ party (PKK) and to followers of Fethullah Gülen, who Ankara accuses of orchestrating a 2016 coup attempt. “We asked them to extradite 30 terrorists, but they refused to do so,” he said. “So you won’t give us back terrorists, but you ask us for Nato membership? Nato is an entity for security, an organisation for security. Therefore, we cannot say ‘Yes’ to this security organisation being deprived of security,” he added. Erdoğan said Nato had never supported Turkey in its fight against the PKK and other Kurdish militant groups, and accused allies of supporting terrorists, citing allied arms deliveries to the People’s Defence Units (YPG), a Kurdish militia fighting in Syria. Other Turkish officials, including Erdoğan’s spokesperson, have been less outspoken, saying Turkey has not shut the door to Sweden and Finland joining Nato but wants negotiations and a pledge to clamp down on what it sees as terrorist activities. Nato, the US and other allies, as well as Helsinki and Stockholm, have all said they are optimistic they can overcome Turkey’s objections. Analysts believe Erdoğan, who faces elections next year, is largely seeking concessions to score domestic political points and is ultimately unlikely to veto the two Nordic applications.

The Turkish foreign minister, Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu, met the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, in New York on Wednesday, but the two diplomats did not address the question of Nato enlargement in their joint statement which reaffirmed their cooperation as partners and Nato allies, and committed them “ to working closely together to face current geopolitical challenges”.

One problem is that because these seismic shifts have been so fast, we’ve never had the time to properly discuss what our role or place in the alliance would be: should we follow the US interests as closely as possible, like Denmark? Or build closer ties with Estonia and [the other] Baltics? Or try to build on a similar peaceful mediator role as before? Mikael Viljanen, 45, teacher, Helsinki, Finland Juhani Viherlahti from Espoo, Finland ‘We should have joined Nato when the other Baltic countries did’ We should have joined Nato as early as the Baltic countries did. In Finland we are used to trusting what has been agreed – even someone’s spoken word is enough. The leaders of Russia have shown now very clearly that they act just the opposite. At the beginning of the Russia-Ukraine war I felt deeply desperate and even paralysed. I experienced similar things when I was a child when my father fought against Russians on the frontline as a medic in the war between the Soviet Union and Finland. In Finland there are a lot of people of Russian origin – most of them do not want war. I feel deep sorrow for the ordinary people in Ukraine and Russia who are suffering. Juhani Viherlahti, 80, chief executive and entrepreneur, Espoo, Finland ‘I feel we’ve missed out the possibility of peace’ It’s all happened too fast as if there was absolutely no other choice. I feel we’ve missed out the possibility of peace. Joining Nato seems very shortsighted from the point of a view of a humanist and pacifist. I feel our country will be less safe and Helsinki could become an easy target for Putin. Katja, 56, psychotherapist, Helsinki, Finland Leif Väisänen from Oulu, Finland. ‘I don’t think highly of Nato or what it does’ My preference is for Finland and Sweden to remain independent from Nato, have no US troops or other weapons as they are not needed or wanted. But with the Russia-Ukraine war it was time to apply to join. I don’t think highly of Nato or what it does. If Finland is allowed to become a member I think there should be no Nato base in the country. Finland has to state that it will remain as a defensive country within Nato, as we’re not into war like the UK, US and others. Russia has complained and made threats since Finland became independent. Sometimes we think Russia should shut up, have a sauna, a beer, and relax. Leif Väisänen, 42, property renovator, Oulu, Finland Sweden: ‘I think it’s a mistake to break neutrality’ Sweden has been neutral for more than 200 years. I think it’s a mistake to break that neutrality; a Nato membership will not be good for us in the long run. It seems the decision is either out of fear of a Russian invasion, or out of spite because Russia told us not to. Either way, fear or spite is not a good enough reason to make such a major decision this quickly. I would not want to be responsible should one of the other Nato nations do something stupid. It would be scary to have such a close military relationship with a country such as Turkey. Maria, 22, works for a textile company, Gothenburg, Sweden Karolina Enquist Källgren from Stockholm, Sweden. ‘There will be a price to pay for Nato protection’ I think that the decision has been taken far too rapidly and without real possibility of democratic influence from other political parties. Firstly, the social democrats do not want the Nato question to be a question under debate in the run-up to the election in September. Secondly, they have been successful during Covid to portray themselves as the party that acts appropriately in times of crisis and they want to continue doing so. Nevertheless, they are abandoning 200 years of neutrality which has served Sweden well. I feel like this is the last part of an ongoing abandonment of the Swedish folkhemmet in which a strong and alliance-free state took care of its citizens. I feel a longing for a society that is now being lost. I also think that there will be a price to pay for Nato protection. Statements by [Recep Tayyip] Erdoğan are already signalling what that might be. I think Russia has little interest in Sweden besides if we join Nato – not joining is probably more secure. Karolina Enquist Källgren, 30s, associate professor, Stockholm, Sweden Tuomas Sihvonen from Finland and living in Malmö, Sweden. ‘We have no choice but to take the leap into Nato’ As a Finn residing in Sweden with a Swedish spouse, we are both sad that Nato wasn’t buried simultaneously with the Warsaw pact. They are both products of a bygone era. EU should have developed a strong European military union already back then. Regrettably, it’s too late for that now. Neighbouring countries such as Iceland, Norway and Denmark have participated in a military alliance led by Washington – for what appears to be no visible benefit to any of them. Today’s situation is awful but we have no choice but to take the leap into Nato because some people in the west have allowed the dictatorship in Russia to flourish. Of course, Putin’s guilt is indisputable. Russia must be stopped.

In other developments: The first war crimes trial since Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine starts in Kyiv on Wednesday. Vadim Shishimarin, 21, has been charged over the death of a 62-year-old man in north-eastern Ukraine on 28 February. The soldier from Irkutsk in Siberia faces a possible life sentence. “He understands what he is being accused of,” his lawyer, Viktor Ovsiannikov, told AFP, without revealing the case for the defence. Two Russian servicemen are due to go on trial from Thursday, accused of firing rockets at civilian infrastructure in the Kharkiv region.
The chief prosecutor for the international criminal court, Karim Khan, said he sent a team of 42 investigators, forensic experts and support personnel to Ukraine to look into suspected war crimes, in the court’s largest ever such operation. Ukraine has accused Russian forces of torturing and killing civilians.
The US announced the launch of a $6m program to capture and analyse evidence of war crimes, including satellite imagery and information shared on social media, so it can be used in ongoing and future accountability mechanisms.
The fate of hundreds of Ukrainian soldiers in Mariupol who have ended weeks of resistance at the Azovstal steelworks remains unclear, after the fighters surrendered and were transferred to Russian-controlled territory. The Russian parliament plans to take up a resolution on Wednesday to prevent the exchange of Azov Regiment fighters, who held out for months inside the plant, according to Russian news agencies.
UN chief Antonio Guterres is expected to publicly disclose on Wednesday that he is in talks with Russia, Ukraine, Turkey, the US and the European Union aimed at restoring Ukraine grain shipments and reviving fertiliser exports from Russia and Belarus. The war in Ukraine has fuelled soaring global prices, which Guterres warned would worsen crises in poor countries. Finland, which shares an 810-mile (1,300km) border with Russia, has remained neutral or non-aligned since the end of the second world war, while Sweden has stayed out of military alliances for more than two centuries. Both had long seen Nato membership as an unnecessary provocation of Russia. Andersson said the simultaneous applications reflected the brutal impact of “Russia’s illegal war” on Ukraine and the Nordic neighbours’ common history, traditions, values ​​and culture. “In recent months, it has also become clear that Sweden’s and Finland’s security are closely linked,” she said. Niinistö said Russia’s onslaught on Ukraine had “changed everything”, adding that Finnish and Swedish Nato membership meant the Nordic region would now be “a bastion not just of democracy, welfare and human rights – but also of security”. The announcements came after the Finnish parliament on Tuesday overwhelmingly backed the government’s proposal to join the alliance, and a day after Sweden’s government confirmed its intention to do likewise. Finnish MPs voted by 188 votes to eight in favour of joining. Nato’s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, has repeatedly said the two countries would be welcomed “with open arms”, but their applications must be approved by all the alliance’s 30 members and Turkey seems set to throw a spanner in the works. Ankara has said it will not support the bids, citing Sweden and Finland’s history of hosting members of Kurdish militant groups and decisions in 2019 to impose arms export embargos on Ankara over Turkey’s military operations in Syria. Niinistö said in an address to Swedish MPs on Tuesday that Turkey’s stance had “changed very quickly and become harder during the last few days”, but he was sure “constructive discussions” would resolve the situation. The Finnish president said his Turkish counterpart, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, had backed the applications when they spoke a month ago, but in the past week “he has said, ‘not favourable’. We have to continue our discussion. I am optimistic.” Andersson said Sweden was “looking forward to having a bilateral dialogue with Turkey. I see when both Sweden and Turkey are members of Nato, there are also opportunities to develop bilateral relations between our countries.” Washington said the administration was confident Nato could reach consensus about the applications. “We know there’s a lot of support for Sweden and Finland to join Nato,” the White House press secretary, Karine Jean-Pierre, said. Erdoğan on Monday said Ankara would oppose the applications and there was no point diplomats even coming to Ankara to discuss it. Turkey alleges Finland and Sweden shelter people it says are linked to groups it designates as terrorist. 00:58'Historic day': Finland's leaders confirm intention to join Nato – video While it is unclear how serious an obstacle Turkey’s objections will prove, many analysts believe Erdoğan, who faces elections next year, was seeking concessions for domestic political advantage and will not ultimately veto the Nordic nations’ applications. “They know Sweden and Finland inside the alliance is good for the alliance as a whole, and I don’t foresee they will block this in the end,” said Anna Wieslander of the Atlantic Council thinktank. “But they will negotiate along the way.” After multiple warnings that Finnish and Swedish membership of Nato would have “serious consequences”, including the possible deployment of nuclear missiles in the Baltic region, Moscow, meanwhile, now appears to be downplaying the prospect. The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, said on Monday he saw “no immediate threat” unless Nato military infrastructure was deployed on Finnish and Swedish territory, and Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, said on Tuesday it would make little difference as the two countries had long taken part in Nato exercises. Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BST “Nato takes their territory into account when planning military advances to the east,” Lavrov said. “So in this sense, there is probably not much difference. Let’s see how their territory is used in practice in the North Atlantic alliance.” Meanwhile, Russia on Tuesday expelled two Finnish diplomats and summoned the Finnish ambassador to hear a protest against the country’s “confrontational course in relation to Russia”. The statement made no mention of Nato membership. The EU’s foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, said that all EU member states would back Finland and Sweden’s applications. “They will receive strong support, I’m sure, from all member states, because it increases our unity and it makes us stronger,” he said in Brussels. Borrell added that he hoped Nato would overcome Turkey’s objections. Germany’s defence minister, Christine Lambrecht, also said that while it was important that members talk “intensively” with Turkey, she was sure Ankara would be won over. “It is an improvement for Nato when two countries as strong as Sweden and Finland join,” Lambrecht said. “I am convinced Turkey will also be convinced of that.”",,,,

To an unusual degree, the national identities of Sweden and Finland are bound up with their foreign policy: Swedes identify with a centuries-old tradition of neutrality, whereas Finns point to their talent for realpolitik, making the best of their volatile geography, which includes an 830-mile border with Russia. As both countries now formally submit their applications to join the North Atlantic alliance, each of them will forgo this deviation from the European norm. Finland in particular now seems poised to adopt a more standard-issue foreign policy. But at what price? Since the end of the second world war, Finland’s political elite has nimbly navigated between Russian and western power. In a tight spot, the Finns played their hand with exceptional skill. In the postwar decades, Finland went from being the poorest state in Europe in 1945 to the economic level of the rest of western Europe – and maintained a much more equal society. Now, Finland is abandoning this careful strategy of tacking between two zones of power for a wholesale embrace of the west, as the country hurtles into the Nato alliance.  On the Finnish right, commentators speak of the country finally clinching its identity as a “western” nation with its entry into Nato. Among Finnish liberals, there is talk of improving and reforming the alliance from within, making it less hawkish, with the help of Sweden. In general, there is the sense that a country whose leaders have long had their finger on the pulse of the Kremlin has lost the count. “There used to be the sense: we know these people; they know us,” the Finnish thinker and legal theorist Martti Koskenniemi told me. “But you can’t negotiate with a power that no longer knows where its interests lie. And if the power is more powerful than you are – and becomes in a sense crazy – then membership in Nato becomes reasonable.” Whether Finland and Sweden will actually be safer in Nato is another question. Their declarations have only drawn a mild rebuke from the Kremlin, which has warned against a military buildup in both countries. Vladimir Putin’s regime has never suggested the possibility of hostilities against either country, with which it has consistently enjoyed cordial relations. Memories of past Russian-Finnish military confrontations suggest that anyone considering about an incursion into Finland should consider medical treatment (Finland has historically been able to mobilise vast swathes of its population; the country also produces its own version of the AK-47, and its elaborate bunker system may make even nuclear weapons less effective against it). One sensitive point in the Finland-Nato question is that Russians make up the largest minority in Finland. Their main representative organisation has made it clear that it can resolve any of its political issues through the procedures of Finnish politics. But some Finnish officials fear Putin could still use Russian grievances inside Finland as a pretext for hostilities. Perhaps an even more salient pretext is Finland is virtually a member of Nato already. Since 1996, Finland has participated in joint Nato exercises in the Baltic states and Nato missions in Iraq, Kosovo and Afghanistan. Some Finnish politicians now believe that if they are already de facto members they might as well get into Nato proper before it is too late. Putin could, they argue, use Finland’s quasi-Nato status as a reason to stop real membership from happening. 00:58'Historic day': Finland's leaders confirm intention to join Nato – video By joining Nato, Finland appears to be giving up an unusual confidence in its own ability to conduct realpolitik. Finland’s peculiarly delicate foreign policy – balanced between Russia and western Europe – typically goes by the name “Finlandization”. Finlandization was a West German invention, forged by the cold war liberals Walter Hallstein and Richard Lowenthal, who fashioned it as a conceptual bludgeon against Chancellor Willy Brandt’s “Ostpolitik” in the 1960s. They feared that Brandt’s attempts to open West Germany to more negotiation with the east risked making West Germany into a zone of semi-Soviet influence. Finlandization, in this sense, was almost always a pejorative that implied subservience to a greater power. But it is a pejorative that most Finns do not recognise in their history. In actual practice, the country benefited from its good relations with the Kremlin and with Europe. “Moscow went so far as to make Finland into an example of what friendly relations with the Soviet Union could bring,” the Finnish sociologist Juho Korhonen told me. In the 1950s, Moscow made a point of sending oil to a Finnish oil refinery and buying back the finished product. “The country’s cold war foreign policy can be usefully thought of as a tango,” says Koskenniemi. “It was two steps forward, one step back.” Meanwhile, Helsinki’s warm relations with western Europe made it increasingly attractive for investment. With Finland now on the verge of joining Nato, the memory of Finlandization risks being retrofitted into its history as a kind of stumbling detour before the country’s foreordained entry into the west. But this would be a pity for the future shape of Europe. It is not that other countries can pursue a policy of Finlandization; suggestions for the “Finlandization” of Ukraine or Georgia do not quite make sense, since neither are in the position to reap the same advantages. But when Finland’s type of aloof posture becomes unsustainable, when there are no longer any zones of ambiguity in Europe, when the continent becomes a more Manichean space, awash with symbolic politics where more extreme measures are required to prove bona fides, then peace is ever more imperilled. How Putin’s invasion returned Nato to the centre stage | Thomas MeaneyRead more Few Finnish elites seem to think they will be manifestly safer in Nato, and no one is fooled about the sacredness of Nato’s article 5. “Nato’s defence of its members is an open-ended negotiation process,” Koskenniemi freely admits. He sees Finland’s entry into Nato operating at the level of appearances. “It’s not that we were very insecure yesterday, and will be very secure in Nato tomorrow,” he says. “It’s that this is a negotiation with a country that can no longer negotiate, and so Nato membership helps clarify our position to them.” But Koskenniemi is fully aware that with Nato membership, another striking feature Finland once exhibited to the world will recede. The very possibility of a state going its own way in Europe now seems slightly more distant.

In their remarks in the Rose Garden, the Finnish president, Sauli Niinistö, and the Swedish prime minister, Magdalena Andersson, addressed the only major barrier to their countries’ accession to the alliance: the objections of the Turkish leader, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, who restated on Thursday his resolve to veto their membership.  “We will continue our policy in a determined way. We have told allies that we will say no to Finland and Sweden’s Nato membership,” Erdoğan told Turkish students in a video uploaded on his official Twitter account. All 30 alliance members have to approve the acceptance of a new ally. Erdoğan accused Sweden and Finland of harbouring and financing the Kurdistan Workers party militant group and Syrian Kurdish YPG, who he deems to be “terrorists”. In his Rose Garden comments, Niinistö addressed those accusations directly. “Finland has always had proud and good bilateral relations with Turkey. As Nato allies, we will commit to Turkey’s security, just as Turkey will commit to our security,” the Finnish president said. “We take terrorism seriously. We condemn terrorism in all its forms and we are actively engaged in combating it. We are open to discussing all the concerns Turkey may have concerning our membership in an open and constructive manner. These discussions have already taken place and they will continue in the next days.” He emphasised the contribution that Finland would make to the alliance. “Finland’s armed forces are one of the strongest in Europe,” Niinistö said. “We have also consistently invested in developing capabilities. The Finns’ willingness to defend the country is one of the highest in the whole world.” In her speech, Andersson said that the Swedish government was “right now having a dialogue with all Nato member countries, including Turkey, on different levels to sort out any issues at hand”. She underlined the historic shift that Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine had brought about. “After 200 years of military non-alignment, Sweden has chosen a new path,” the Swedish prime minister said. “Russia’s full scale aggression against a sovereign and democratic neighbour was a watershed moment for Sweden. And my government has come to the conclusion that the security of the Swedish people will be best protected within the Nato alliance. And this is backed by very broad support in the Swedish parliament.” 04:05'A dangerous neighbour': why Finland and Sweden want to join Nato – video explainer Biden did not refer to Turkish opposition in his upbeat speech outside the White House, but noted that both candidate Nato members “meet every Nato requirement and then some”.

But they have not travelled the same road to the alliance’s Brussels headquarters. Russia’s unprovoked onslaught on Ukraine – ostensibly intended, at least in part, to prevent Nato’s expansion – has ended up achieving the reverse, as the Nordic neighbours have abandoned decades of military non-alignment in a seismic shift in Europe’s security order.  Each had very different grounds for staying out of the alliance until now, their neutrality rooted in different geographies, histories and national identities. Both reached the same decision this week, but what went into it was not the same. Finland’s neutrality, experts say, was only ever functional, the only possible way of dealing with the fact that it shares an 830-mile (1,340km) border with Russia, won independence from Russia only in 1917, and twice repelled everything the Red Army threw at it during the second world war. “Finnish security policy has always been entirely pragmatic; we’ve just gone for what’s best for us, with no real ideological considerations,” said Minna Ålander, an expert on northern Europe at the German Institute for International and Security Affairs in Berlin. She said the approach was based on “good relations with Russia, and maintaining a high security capability. Well, since February, the first no longer holds.” For Finland, the membership conversation was all about security: Russia had become an unreliable and brutal neighbour, and only Nato’s collective defence would be enough. How Vladimir Putin rejuvenated Nato – podcastRead more It was a big step. Those bitter Finno-Soviet conflicts – in particular the 1939-40 winter war, in which a Finnish army outnumbered three to one inflicted five times the losses it sustained – are a core part of modern Finland’s history and remain a source of lasting national pride. But Finland was eventually forced to cede 10% of its territory, and in 1948 signed a friendship and cooperation treaty with the Soviet Union. “We had to accept it was the biggest regional power,” said Henrik Meinander, a University of Helsinki historian. “But we were proud we had avoided occupation. It was a very functional approach; we understood the west would not defend us. And it continued after we joined the EU. But we have always been prepared for things to get worse.” In fact, experts point out, if neutrality – succeeded, after EU membership in 1995, by military non-alignment – has been a fundamental part of Finland’s foreign and security policy for 73 years, in practice things are a little less clear cut. “A lot of deliberate work has gone on since the 1990s to make this moment possible,” said Ålander. Finland’s military, with a fighting strength of 280,000 troops and 900,000 reservists, has a high level of military interoperability with the alliance, and a “Nato option” to allow for rapid accession when the time came. As early as 1992, while it was negotiating to join the EU, Helsinki bought 64 US-made Hornet fighter bombers, a clear indication of which way it was looking, Meinander said. But “politically, culturally, symbolically – this [Nato application] remains a huge move”, he added. Finnish politicians talk of a “moment of national awakening”. Even in January, when Russian troops were massing on Ukraine’s border, Finland’s prime minister, Sanna Marin, was saying it was “very unlikely” that Finland would join Nato during her term. But when parliament voted on the question this week, only eight of its 200 MPs objected. Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BST A dramatic shift in public opinion has led the way. Last year one poll put support for Nato membership in Finland at 34%. Last week it stood at 76%. “So yes, I think we can say it’s seismic,” said Ålander. “Logical, yes; something we’ve been preparing for, and working towards the possibility of, absolutely. But I don’t think anyone will tell you that for Finland this isn’t a historic change.” The change in Sweden is equally monumental, said Gunilla Herolf, a senior associate research fellow at the Swedish Institute of International Affairs. “We have maintained one doctrine for 200 years,” she said. “That’s a big deal. It means something to people. It becomes an identity issue.” Ask Swedes for three things that define their country, she said, and many might reply “hunting elk, eating fermented herring – and non-alignment”. With Finland serving as a buffer against Russia, Sweden, which has fought no wars and joined no alliances since 1812, could fashion its neutrality along more idealistic, ideological lines. Finland and Sweden may join Nato – but even they can’t guarantee that will make them safer | Thomas MeaneyRead more “We were protected behind Finland, which unlike us never felt safe,” Herolf said. “We had the luxury of being able to say what we liked.” So over the past two centuries, but especially since 1945, Sweden carved out an enviable space for itself: peace, nuclear disarmament, international mediation, support for fledgling democracies worldwide. That became part of the national self-image – and especially of the identity of Sweden’s mighty Social Democrats, who have won every election for 100 years. Many on the left still feel Nato’s nuclear deterrent raises tensions, will make Sweden less safe and cost it its pre-eminent role in global disarmament. Herolf noted that Sweden, too, had “not always acted as a neutral or non-aligned country should”. It sent military aid to Finland during the winter war, and during the cold war it had secret security contact with the UK and the US – to the point of building runways way longer than its planes needed, to accommodate US jets. She does not buy the Nordic arguments about Finns being inherently more pragmatic than supposedly idealistic Swedes. “I’m not sure Sweden would’ve acted differently to Finland if it had been in Finland’s geographical position,” Herolf said. But it wasn’t, so it cut back its military in the 1990s, and ended conscription, before bringing it back and boosting defence spending again from 2014, when Russia annexed Crimea. Still, many in Sweden – where about 55% now support Nato membership – feel, at the very least, that the decision has been rushed. Many also regret that, albeit for understandable reasons, it was Finland – Swedish territory for 600 years – that led the dance. “Finland’s swift decision kind of hijacked the Swedish debate,” said Ålander. “Sweden couldn’t be the only Nordic country outside Nato.” The exposure, added Herolf, would have been too great. Hence, finally, the “hand-in-hand” approach: an acknowledgment of the neighbours’ strong security interdependence and cooperation in defiance of those different national stories. Finland is, at any rate, “very grateful that Sweden, despite the ideological obstacles, has taken this step”, said Meinander. Neither country expects major consequences. Russia has halted electricity exports to Finland and is about to do the same with gas, but both represent less than 10% of overall supplies and have been replaced. Other than that, said Ålander, it would be “disinfo, cyber-attacks, maybe a few airspace violations. We’re ready for that.” When it finally came to it, she said, Russia – in spite of its multiple prior threats – essentially acknowledged what everyone knew already: Finland and Sweden were a lost cause to Moscow the moment they joined the EU. “A lot of people were really surprised by how calmly Russia has taken it,” she said.

The ministry said air-launched missiles hit three command points and four ammunition depots in the Donbas. In Mykolaiv, in the south, Russian rockets reportedly struck a mobile anti-drone system near the settlement of Hannivka.
Severodonetsk is one of Russia’s “immediate tactical priorities”, the UK Ministry of Defence said on Sunday. Russia is deploying Terminator tanks to the area, the MoD has said. 
Severodonetsk has been attacked from “four separate directions”, said the region’s governor. Serhiy Haidai said Russian forces had not succeeded in breaking into the city.
Volodymyr Zelenskiy has accused Russia of blocking the export of 22m tonnes of food. The Ukrainian president also said an energy crisis would swiftly follow a food crisis if Ukraine was not given help to unlock its ports.
Only Ukraine has the right to decide its future, the Polish president told lawmakers in Kyiv on Sunday. Andrzej Duda said: “Worrying voices have appeared, saying that Ukraine should give in to Putin’s demands. Only Ukraine has the right to decide about its future … nothing about you without you.” Duda became the first foreign leader to give a speech in person to the Ukrainian parliament since Russia’s invasion.
Russia’s state gas company, Gazprom, halted gas exports to Finland, which refused Moscow’s demands to pay in roubles for Russian gas after western countries imposed sanctions. Gasum, Finland’s state-owned energy company, said it would use other sources, such as the Balticconnector pipeline, which links Finland to its fellow EU member Estonia.
Ukraine has suggested it is willing to resume talks with Russia. Speaking on Saturday, Zelenskiy said: “Discussions between Ukraine and Russia will undoubtedly take place … under what format I don’t know … but the war will be bloody, there will be fighting and [it] will only definitively end through diplomacy.” He added: “We want everything back. And the Russian Federation doesn’t want to return anything. That’s why the ending will be at the negotiating table.”",,,,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7d402af5cb58d300d26faf9b18086513247d30f6/0_184_4032_2419/master/4032.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=fd13b6b9548b1e6b211deafe687375dd

In the meantime, here’s a roundup of the latest developments:
Ukraine has said it will not agree to any ceasefire deal that would involve handing over territory to Russia, as Moscow intensified its attack in the eastern Donbas region. “The war must end with the complete restoration of Ukraine’s territorial integrity and sovereignty,” said Ukraine’s presidential chief of staff, Andriy Yermak.
The comments came as Russia said it was willing to resume peace negotiations, Russia’s lead negotiator said Sunday, but the initiative to continue them is with Kyiv. Kremlin aide Vladimir Medinsky claimed in an interview with Belarusian TV that “Russia has never refused talks”.
Polish president Andrzej Duda became the first foreign leader to address the Ukrainian parliament in person since the invasion began, backing Ukraine’s stance on territorial concessions and warning the international community that ceding any territory to Russia would be a “huge blow” to the entire West.
Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy said that 50 to 100 Ukrainians were dying every day on the war’s eastern front in what appeared to be a reference to military casualties. The heaviest fighting is focused around the twin cities of Sievierodonetsk and Lysychansk in Luhansk, one of the two regions that make up the Donbas. Serhiy Gaidai, the governor of Luhansk, said in a local television interview that Russia was using “scorched-earth” tactics in the region.
Ukraine is set to top the agenda at the four-day World Economic Forum, which kicks off on Monday with a video address by Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy. This year Russia’s “house” at the event was transformed into a “Russian War Crimes House”, portraying images of misery and devastation.
UK prime minister Boris Johnson spoke with Zelenskiy about Russia’s blockade of Odesa, Ukraine’s largest shipping port. The blockade of Ukraine’s ports has been a growing concern for world leaders as many continue to warn about global food security, in particular for developing countries.
The Moscow-installed mayor of Enerhodar, a southern city of Ukraine and the location of Europe’s largest nuclear power plant, has been wounded in an explosion. Russian news agency RIA Novosti reported that Andrey Shevchik was in intensive care.
A bid by Ukraine to join the European Union would not be finalised for “15 or 20 years,” France’s Europe minister said. “We have to be honest. If you say Ukraine is going to join the EU in six months, or a year or two, you’re lying. It’s probably in 15 or 20 years, it takes a long time,” Clément Beaune said.
Zelenskiy has extended Ukraine’s martial law for three months through to 23 August. Ukraine’s parliament also banned the symbols “Z” and “V”, used by Russia’s military to promote its war in Ukraine but agreed to Zelenskiy’s call to allow their use for educational or historic purposes.
Olena Zelenska has given a rare interview with Volodymyr Zelenskiy, only their second public appearance together since Russia launched its invasion. She recounts the “anxiety and stupor” she felt on 24 February, and says that even though she has barely seen her husband since “no one, not even the war, could take him away” from her.
Technicians linked to the Syrian military’s infamous barrel bombs that have wreaked devastation across much of the country have been deployed to Russia to help potentially prepare for a similar campaign in the Ukraine war, European officials believe. Intelligence officers say more than 50 specialists have been in Russia for several weeks working alongside officials from Vladimir Putin’s military.
YouTube has taken down more than 70,000 videos and 9,000 channels related to the war in Ukraine for violating content guidelines, including removal of videos that referred to the invasion as a “liberation mission”. 22 May 202200.30Ukraine’s parliament on Sunday banned the symbols “Z” and “V”, used by Russia’s military to promote its war in Ukraine but agreed to president Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s call to allow their use for educational or historic purposes, Reuters reports.Yaroslav Zheleznyak, an opposition member, announced the decision on the Telegram messaging app, saying 313 deputies had voted in favour in the 423-member Verkhovna Rada assembly.The letter ‘Z’ is seen on a destroyed Russian tank on March 31, 2022 in Malaya Rohan, Ukraine. Photograph: Chris McGrath/Getty ImagesZelenskiy had vetoed an earlier version of the bill and called for the two symbols to be allowed in displays in museums, libraries, scientific works, re-enactments, textbooks and similar instances.Neither of the two letters exists in the Russian alphabet. They have been widely used, particularly on Russian military vehicles and equipment, to promote the aims of the conflict.The new bill bans the creation of non-governmental organisations using Russian war symbols or undermining Ukraine’s sovereignty.The Ukrainian parliament on Sunday also extended for another 90 days, or until 23 August, the period of martial law in the country.Updated at 00.45 BST 22 May 202223.46Hello, this is Helen Livingstone taking over the blog from my colleague Vivian Ho.Ukrainian-Polish relations are “finally on a completely clean, sincere basis, without any quarrels and old conflict heritage,” Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said in his latest nightly address after welcoming Polish president Andrzej Duda to Kyiv.In recognition of a law in Poland that gives Ukrainians the same opportunities as Poles, Zelenskiy said Ukraine was preparing a similar bill in Ukraine for Poles. Let it be so that the citizens of Poland will never have to use such a law. But let us show our gratitude and our respect.
And I also want it to be part of our new neighborhood policy. We must resolve disputes and remove the pressure of the past from our current relations with all Ukraine’s neighbors who respect us and are not occupiers of our state.He also said a new decision to introduce joint customs controls with Poland was “revolutionising” the countries’ border and was a step towards Ukraine’s entry into the European Union. This will significantly speed up border procedures. It will remove most of the corruption risks. But it is also the beginning of our integration into the common customs space of the European Union. That is a truly historical process.He also said he had spoken to UK prime minister Boris Johnson to discuss ways of increasing exports, especially agricultural products, and increasing fuel imports to Ukraine. 22 May 202223.30Today so farIt is 1:30am in Ukraine. 
President Volodymyr Zelenskiy warned that with the fighting in the eastern region, Ukraine may lose up to 100 soldiers a day.
Ukraine has been somewhat opaque about the scale of its combat losses The fact that Zelenskiy is being open about casualty rates equivalent to 3,000 Ukrainians giving their lives in a month is a sign of how brutal the fight is https://t.co/VxeeMIXkzQ— Emma Graham-Harrison (@_EmmaGH) May 22, 2022

The blockade of Ukraine’s ports has been a growing concern for world leaders as many continue to warn about global food security, in particular for developing countries. Before the invasion in February, Ukraine was known as the bread basket of Europe, exporting 4.5m tonnes of agricultural produce a month through its ports – 12% of global wheat supply, 15% of corn and half of sunflower oil. Last week, Antony Blinken, the US secretary of state, accused Russia of “using food as a weapon” with its blockade of ports.

It’s up to judges to decide. I just do my job.”
“My family, friends and colleagues support me,” Ovsyannikov added. “They know someone has to do it.

Jens Stoltenberg, the secretary general of the western military alliance, said countries would be making a mistake if they traded short-term economic gain for long-term security.  “Freedom is more important than free trade. The protection of our values is more important than profit,” Stoltenberg told the World Economic Forum. Davos day two: Freedom more important than free trade, says Nato’s Stoltenberg – live updatesRead more The Nato head said globalisation had brought many economic benefits but the war in Ukraine had exposed how ties with authoritarian regimes created vulnerabilities. Breaking down barriers in the pursuit of free trade had left Europe dependent on Russian oil and gas, involved the sharing of technology that risked the west losing its technological edge in modern weaponry and opened the door to foreign control of vital infrastructure such as 5G networks. “If we share the technology we may earn the money but undermine western security,” Stoltenberg said. “This is about Russia but it is also about China.” As a former prime minister of Norway, Stoltenberg said he had worked to create a more global economy. “But our economic choices have consequences for security,” he said. “I am not arguing against trade with China but I am saying the control over 5G networks is of vital security importance,” he said. “We cannot say that in the interest of profits and free trade we just open up those networks also for suppliers that actually are not reliable when it comes to our security,” Stoltenberg added. The Nato secretary-general said the build up of western forces in eastern Europe was intended to deter Russia from further aggression and there was no intention to become involved in military action. “This is deterrence, not to provoke a conflict but to prevent a conflict and preserve peace,” he said. Vladimir Putin had launched a war to have “less Nato” on his borders, Stoltenberg said. “He is now getting more Nato on his borders and more Nato members.” Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, said Russia’s decision to “weaponise its food supplies” would have global repercussions. Russia was “using hunger and grain to wield power” and blackmail other countries, she added. “In Russian-occupied Ukraine, the Kremlin’s army is confiscating grain stocks and machinery. For some, this has brought back memories from a dark past – the times of the Soviet crop seizures and the devastating famine of the 1930s,” Von der Leyen said in a special address. “Today, Russia’s artillery is bombarding grain warehouses across Ukraine – deliberately. And Russian warships in the Black Sea are blockading Ukrainian ships full of wheat and sunflower seeds,” Von der Leyen added. Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk She said there were 20m tonnes of wheat stuck in Ukraine. That has created a shortage that has sent global wheat prices rocketing, and meant food shipments from Odesa could not reach Somalia. Von der Leyen said Europe was opening solidarity lanes, linking Ukraine’s borders to its ports, stepping up its own production, and working with the World Food Programme to get supplies to vulnerable countries. “Global cooperation is the antidote to Russia’s blackmail,” she said.

These, he said, are “the terrible consequences of Russian aggression”.As my colleagues Shaun Walker and Lorenzo Tondo reported earlier: the Russian-speaking city at the border of Ukraine was pounded by artillery for first time in two weeks, just as life there was beginning to to normal.Russian troops had been pushed back over the past few weeks, but remained within arrillery range of the city. Kharkiv hit by fresh strikes amid fears city is still on Russian agendaRead more 27 May 202201.13SummaryWe will be pausing our live coverage of the war in Ukraine for the next few hours.Before we return, here is a comprehensive rundown of where things currently stand.
Kharkiv has been hit by fresh strikes amid fears the city is still on Russia’s agenda. At least nine civilians were killed, including a child, and 19 injured, authorities said. “Today, the occupiers shelled Kharkiv again. At the moment, the list of the dead includes nine people. 19 wounded. All civilians,” Zelenskiy said. Residents have been urged to go to, or remain in, shelters.

Officials in Ukraine have admitted that Russia has the “upper hand” in fighting in the country’s east. The governor of the Luhansk region, Serhiy Haidai, said just 5% of the area now remained in Ukrainian hands – down from about 10% little more than a week ago – and that Ukrainian forces were retreating in some areas. “The Russian army has thrown all its forces at taking the Luhansk region,” he said in a video on Telegram. “Extremely fierce fighting is taking place on the outskirts of Severodonetsk. They are simply destroying the city, they are shelling it every day, shelling without pause.”

The Kremlin has rejected claims that Russia has blocked grain exports from Ukraine, blaming the west for creating such a situation by imposing sanctions on Russia. The UK’s foreign minister, Liz Truss, accused Vladimir Putin of “weaponising” hunger through Russia’s blockade of Ukrainian grain exports. A senior Turkish official said Ankara was in “ongoing” talks with Russia and Ukraine to open a corridor via the Bosphorus.

Two captured Russian soldiers have pleaded guilty to shelling a town in eastern Ukraine, in the second war crimes trial since Russian troops invaded the country. Alexander Bobikin and Alexander Ivanov acknowledged being part of an artillery unit that fired at targets in the Kharkiv region from Russia’s Belgorod region.

There are about 8,000 Ukrainian prisoners of war held in the Russian-backed self-proclaimed Luhansk and Donetsk People’s Republics, the Luhansk official Rodion Miroshnik has said. “That’s a lot, and literally hundreds are being added every day,” Miroshnik was quoted by the Russian Tass news agency as saying.

The deputy prime minister of the Russian-appointed Crimean government, Georgy Muradov, has said the Sea of Azov is “forever lost to Ukraine”. Russia’s Ria news agency also quoted a Russian-appointed official in the occupied Zaporizhzhia region as saying that the Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions would never be returned to the control of the Kyiv.

Russia has deployed mobile propaganda vans with large-screen televisions to humanitarian aid points in the captured city of Mariupol. The Orwellian turn comes as the Kremlin continued to push forward with efforts to integrate newly occupied territories across the south of Ukraine.

Antony Blinken, the US secretary of state, has said China’s cooperation with Vladimir Putin after his invasion of Ukraine “raises alarm bells”. Blinken criticised the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, for defending Putin’s “war to erase Ukraine’s sovereignty” and said it was “a charged moment for the world”.

Alexander Lukashenko, the Belarusian president who is a close Putin ally, has ordered the creation of a new military command for the south of the country bordering Ukraine. The Belarusian armed forces previously said they would deploy special operations troops in three areas near its southern border with Ukraine. Lukashenko has also talked up the role of Russian-made missiles in boosting the country’s defences.

Dmytro Kuleba, Ukraine’s Foreign Minister, said that “weapons, weapons and weapons again” are what the country needs. “We need more heavy weapons delivered as soon as possible, especially MLRS (multiple launch rocket systems) to repel Russian attacks,” Kuleba said.

The US is preparing to send advanced, long-range rocket systems to Ukraine after an urgent request from Ukrainian officials, multiple officials reportedly told CNN. Kuleba said Ukraine’s most urgent need is for multiple launch rocket systems (MLRS) to counter Russian superiority in heavy weaponry. Zelenskiy also referred to the weapons as “the systems that are really needed to stop this aggression” in his latest address.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has complained about divisions inside the European Union over more sanctions against Russia and asked why some nations were being allowed to block the plan. “How many more weeks will the European Union try to agree on a sixth package?” Zelenskiy asked in his latest national address. “Pressure on Russia is literally a matter of saving lives,” he added.

Russian President Vladimir Putin and Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi held a phone call to discuss the situation in Ukraine and the issue of global food security on Thursday. Speaking to journalists after the call, Draghi said he would continue talking to both Moscow and Kyiv to resolve the food crisis, but added that he had little optimism for ending the war. “When asked if I have seen any glimmer of hope for peace, the answer is no,” he said.
Russian troops occupying the south-eastern port city of Mariupol have cancelled school summer holidays to prepare pupils for switching to a Russian curriculum, according to officials. “The main goal is to eradicate everything Ukrainian and prepare for the new school year, which will be according to the Russian curriculum,” city official Petro Andryushchenko said.

Today, the occupiers shelled Kharkiv again. At the moment, the list of the dead includes nine people. 19 wounded. All civilians. A child (five months) and a father were killed. The mother is in grave condition. Among the wounded in Kharkiv is also a nine-year-old girl.”Missile strikes continues in the Sumy region, in Donbas again, he added. “Significant intensification of the occupiers’ artillery in the Zaporizhzhia region again. Again, their efforts to burrow into the ground in the south.” 26 May 202200.18US to send long-range rocket systems to Ukraine - reportsThe US is preparing to send advanced, long-range rocket systems to Ukraine after an urgent request from Ukrainian officials, multiple officials reportedly told CNN.The Biden administration is leaning toward sending the systems as part of a larger package of military and security assistance to Ukraine, which could be announced as soon as next week, the outlet reported.Senior Ukrainian officials, including President Volodymyr Zelenskiy and foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba, have pleaded in recent weeks for the US and its allies to provide the Multiple Launch Rocket System, or MLRS. The US-made weapon systems can fire a barrage of rockets hundreds of kilometres — much farther than any of the systems Ukraine already has — which the Ukrainians argue could be a game-changer in their war against Russia.Earlier this week, Kuleba said Ukraine’s most urgent need is for multiple launch rocket systems (MLRS) to counter Russian superiority in heavy weaponry.Spoke with my German counterpart @ABaerbock and briefed her on the difficult situation in the Donbas. We need more heavy weapons delivered as soon as possible, especially MLRS, to repel Russian attacks.

Zelenskiy also referred to the weapons as “the systems that are really needed to stop this aggression” in his latest address.Russia has in recent weeks pummelled Ukraine in the east, where Ukraine is outmanned and outgunned, Ukrainian officials said.Another system Ukraine has asked for is the High Mobility Artillery Rocket System, known as HIMARS, a lighter wheeled system capable of firing many of the same types of ammunition as MLRS.Updated at 00.23 BST 26 May 202200.03A Ukrainian official has said that Russian troops occupying the south-eastern port city of Mariupol have cancelled school summer holidays to prepare pupils for switching to a Russian curriculum.The city fell to Russian forces last week following a weeks-long siege at the Azovstal steel works plant. City official Petro Andryushchenko said:“The occupiers have announced the extension of the school year to September 1. That means no holidays. 
The main goal is to eradicate everything Ukrainian and prepare for the new school year, which will be according to the Russian curriculum.” “Throughout the summer, children will have to study Russian language, literature and history as well as maths classes in Russian,” Andryushchenko added.He said the city’s Russian leadership were having trouble enlisting teachers to take on the job, with “only 53 teachers for nine schools”.He did not say how many pupils would miss their summer holidays in the city. 26 May 202223.33Divisions in EU over Russia sanctions is 'matter of saving lives', Zelenskiy saysUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has complained about divisions inside the European Union over more sanctions against Russia and asked why some nations were being allowed to block the plan.The EU is discussing a sixth round of punitive measures, including an embargo on Russian oil imports. Such a move requires unanimity but Hungary opposes the idea for now on the grounds its economy would suffer too much.“How many more weeks will the European Union try to agree on a sixth package?” Zelenskiy asked in a late night address on Thursday, noting that Russia was receiving a billion euros a day from the 27-nation bloc for energy supplies.“Of course I am grateful to those friends who are advocating new sanctions. But where do the people blocking this sixth package get their power from? Why are they allowed to hold such power?” he asked.Berlin hopes talks on the new round of sanctions will be completed soon but it will not be a topic at a leaders’ summit next week, a German official said on Wednesday.Pressure on Russia is literally a matter of saving lives. And every day of procrastination, weakness, various disputes or proposals to ‘pacify’ the aggressor at the expense of the victim merely means more Ukrainians being killed,” he said.On Wednesday he savaged suggestions that Kyiv make concessions to bring peace, saying the idea smacked of attempts to appease Nazi Germany in 1938.He also reiterated complaints that the world had so far failed to totally isolate the Russian banking system and was not providing heavy weapons quickly enough.Updated at 23.44 BST 26 May 202223.04Kharkiv death toll rises to 9 deadNine people were killed in Kharkiv Thursday, the regional governor said, and 19 were injured.

Russia will not request a ceasefire while they are on the offensive. But when they request a ceasefire we will think twice and three times before considering. 26 May 202221.08US officials are questioning Americans who travel to Ukraine to fight Russia, citing domestic security issues, reports Politico’s Besty Woodruff Swan and Christopher Miller: U.S. officials, worried about domestic security issues, have been questioning Americans at airports as they travel to Ukraine to fight Russia, according to an intelligence bulletin reviewed by POLITICO.
The document shows that the U.S. government is gathering information about Americans traveling to Ukraine and is interested in their activity after they return. But critics say the focus on “violent extremist-white supremacists” echoes one of the Kremlin’s top propaganda points: that supporting Ukraine means also supporting neo-Nazis.
It comes as Washington grapples with a messy challenge: dissuading Americans from fighting alongside soldiers who have received some of their training and many of their weapons from the U.S. itself.
The Justice Department has not said whether it’s legal for Americans to join the Ukraine conflict. But no Americans are known to face criminal charges just for traveling to Ukraine to fight Russia, which invaded its neighbor on Feb. 24. This document shows that if law enforcement officials wanted to bring charges, they’ve had plenty of opportunities.Read the full article here.Updated at 21.36 BST 26 May 202220.54Ukraine president Volodymyr Zelenskiy will be speaking virtually tomorrow at Stanford University, according to a tweet from a current professor at the school.

Updated at 21.35 BST 26 May 202220.38Here’s a story from the Guardian’s Pjotr Sauer about a Russian soldier’s life as a prisoner of war:  Still getting used to the feel of his gun and military fatigues, Anton suddenly found himself surrounded by Ukrainian forces as bullets flew by, with one striking his arm.
“It was our first confrontation with the enemy; we hadn’t even fired a shot. They ambushed us, and we couldn’t fight back. We had to surrender,” said Anton, a 21-year-old Russian serviceman, in an interview with the Guardian.
Anton was taken captive by Ukrainian forces near Mykolaiv on 2 March with five other soldiers from his unit, as Russian forces were staging an offensive on the strategically important shipbuilding city near the Black Sea.
Anton, who asked not to be identified with his real name, would spend the next 45 days in Ukrainian captivity. He was eventually released in mid-April after Moscow arranged a prisoner exchange with Ukraine, and spoke to the Guardian from Russian territory.
Anton’s story is a very rare account of a Russian PoW who has since been exchanged, as both Russia and Ukraine have released very little information about the fate of the hundreds of captive Russians.
Moscow does not publicise the names of its service people captured in Ukraine. However, during his captivity, Anton was interviewed as a Russian prisoner by a prominent Ukrainian vlogger. He was also named as a captured Russian soldier on websites close to the Ukrainian authorities.Read the full story here. ‘You shake at the smallest of noises’: Russian soldier tells of life as a PoWRead moreUpdated at 20.43 BST 26 May 202220.20World Health Organization (WHO) member states strongly condemned Russia today for its invasion of Ukraine and attacks on healthcare sites, reports AFP. At WHO’s annual healthcare convention, the resolution condemning Russia was approved by 88 votes, with 12 votes against. A Russian counter-resolution on the health crisis in Ukraine did not get approved. The approved resolution says that it “condemns in the strongest terms” Russia’s “military aggression against Ukraine, including attacks on healthcare facilities”. The resolution also demands Russia “immediately cease any attacks on hospitals” and other healthcare facilities.Ukrainian ambassador Yevheniia Filipenko said that the resolution and vote “sends a clear signal to the Russian Federation: stop your war against Ukraine. Stop attacks on hospitals.” “The World Health Assembly confirmed that the responsibility for the health crisis in Ukraine rests exclusively with the Russian Federation,” added Filipenko.

During a live question and answer session on Twitter, Kuleba said that the military situation in Ukraine’s eastern part is worse than many people say. Kuleba added that Ukraine still needs heavy weaponry to effective fight Russia. Updated at 20.28 BST 26 May 202220.02Kharkiv hit by fresh strikes amid fears city is still on Russian agendaThis is the latest update on the situation in Kharkiv from Shaun Walker and Lorenzo Tondo:Artillery has pounded the city of Kharkiv for the first time in two weeks, just as life in Ukraine’s second city was starting to return to normal after Russian troops were pushed back from its outlying towns and villages.Kharkiv’s regional governor, Oleh Synehubov, said at least seven people had been killed and 17 injured in the attacks on the northern part of the city.“There’s no logic to it, it’s just terror against the local population, to sow panic and to destroy critical infrastructure,” said Synehubov, dressed in military fatigues with a pistol at his hip, in an interview with the Guardian in central Kharkiv shortly after the attacks.The largely Russian-speaking city near the border of the two countries was heavily attacked during the first days of the war as Russian forces tried to take control, but they were pushed back to the suburbs. The Russians sent artillery and missiles into the city, on one occasion destroying the regional administration building, housed in a grand Stalin-era structure.The Russians have been pushed further back over the last six weeks as Ukrainian forces regained control of several towns and villages, but they remain well within artillery range of the city centre.“For two weeks it’s been relatively quiet … I think this is them saying hello, telling us they are still there, trying to create panic,” Synehubov said.A damaged car is seen at shelled Severnaya Saltyvka residential area, as Russia’s attack on Ukraine continues, in Kharkiv, Ukraine May 26, 2022.

The US president told 1,200 graduating cadets in Annapolis, Maryland, on Friday: “Not only is he trying to take over Ukraine, he’s literally trying to wipe out the culture and identity of the Ukrainian people. Attacking schools, nurseries, hospitals, museums, with no other purpose than to eliminate a culture.”  The Russian president tried to “Finland-ize” Europe, Biden said, but “instead he Nato-ized all of Europe”, a reference to neutral nations Finland and Sweden’s plans to join the alliance. Russia is guilty of inciting genocide in Ukraine, expert report concludesRead more On the ground, in the besieged eastern Ukrainian city of Sievierodonetsk, the situation appeared bleak, with Luhansk’s governor, Serhiy Haidai, saying Ukrainian forces may need to retreat after Russian troops entered the city, the largest in Donbas still held by Ukraine. “The Russians will not be able to capture Luhansk region in the coming days as analysts have predicted,” Haidai said on Telegram, referring to Sievierodonetsk and its twin city Lysychansk across the Siverskiy Donets river. “We will have enough strength and resources to defend ourselves. However it is possible that in order not to be surrounded we will have to retreat.” Haidai said 90% of buildings in the city were damaged. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, accepted the situation in Donbas was “very difficult”, saying in a Friday night address that invading forces “have concentrated maximum artillery, maximum reserves” to the region. “There are missiles strikes and aircraft attacks – everything,” he said. “We are protecting our land in the way that our current defence resources allow. We are doing everything to increase them. And we will increase them. “If the occupiers think that Lyman or Sievierodonetsk will be theirs, they are wrong. Donbas will be Ukrainian.” map of donbas Zelenskiy also appealed to European leaders for help with fuel shortages sparked by Russian airstrikes on a refinery in Kremenchuk and on oil depots across the country. Analysts believe the main Russian effort appeared still to be focused to the east, while Russian attacks elsewhere appeared to be aimed at consolidating their positions and tying down Ukrainian defenders who could otherwise be redeployed. Ukraine’s foreign minister offered a bleak assessment of fighting the east. “The military situation in eastern Ukraine is even worse than people say it is and the country needs heavy weapons now to effectively fight Russia,” Dmytro Kuleba said. His comments came as the US and its allies indicated they would provide Ukraine with increasingly sophisticated weapons, including the multiple-launch rocket systems for which Kyiv has been appealing. The British prime minister, Boris Johnson, told Bloomberg UK that Putin “at great cost to himself and to the Russian military, is continuing to chew through ground in Donbas”. “He’s continuing to make gradual, slow, but I’m afraid palpable, progress and therefore it is absolutely vital that we continue to support the Ukrainians militarily,” he said. Russian troops advanced after piercing Ukrainian lines last week in the city of Popasna, south of Sievierodonetsk. Russian ground forces have now captured several villages north-west of Popasna, the UK Ministry of Defence said. Russia’s eastern gains follow a Ukrainian counter-offensive that pushed Moscow’s forces back from Ukraine’s second city Kharkiv in May. But Ukrainian forces have been unable to attack Russian supply lines to the Donbas. On Friday, the Moscow branch of Kyiv’s Orthodox church said it was cutting ties with Russia over its invasion of Ukraine, declaring “full independence” in a historic move against Russia’s spiritual authorities. “We disagree with the position of Patriarch Kirill of Moscow ... on the war,” the church said in a statement after holding a council focused on Russia’s “aggression” and declaring the “full independence and autonomy of the Ukrainian Orthodox church”. “The council condemns war as a violation of God’s commandment ‘You shall not kill!’ and expresses condolences to all those who are suffering in the war,” it said. Patriarch Kirill has expressed clear support for Putin’s invasion of Ukraine. It said its relations with the Moscow leadership had been “complicated or absent” since martial law was declared in Ukraine. The council also appealed to both Ukraine and Russia to “continue the negotiation process” and find a way to “stop the bloodshed”. Speaking to AFP, church spokesman Archbishop Kliment said of Patriarch Kirill: “Not only did he fail to condemn Russia’s military aggression but he also failed to find words for the suffering Ukrainian people.” The Russian Orthodox church said it had “not received an official statement from the Ukrainian Orthodox church” and was unable to comment, spokesman Vladimir Legoida wrote on Telegram. He said the Ukrainian Orthodox church was in “a very difficult position and under pressure from many directions: from the authorities, from schemers, from nationalistic-minded people ... and the media”.

The White House has been weighing up pleas from Ukraine – which is losing ground in the battle for Donbas – for multiple-launch rocket systems (MLRS) to offset Moscow’s increasingly effective use of long-range artillery, amid Russian warnings that doing so would cross a red line.  “We are not going to send to Ukraine rocket systems that can strike into Russia,” Biden told reporters on Monday after arriving back at the White House after a weekend in Delaware. The US-made MLRS comes in many different variants, which in turn use a variety of munitions. The longest range can fire missiles up to 185 miles away, but others use rockets with shorter ranges of 20 to 40 miles. Russia-Ukraine war: what we know on day 96 of the invasionRead more The precise meaning of Biden’s remark on Monday was unclear, but it was consistent with other briefings from the weekend that the White House was willing to provide MLRS as long as it withheld the longest-range missiles. That was repeated on Monday. One senior US official said: “MLRS is under consideration, but nothing is on the table with long-range strike capabilities.” The former Russian president Dmitry Medvedev described Biden’s remarks as “reasonable” and warned that if his country’s cities had been struck, then Russian forces would “have struck at the centres of these criminal decisions”. Ukraine appears close to losing the city of Sievierodonetsk, the easternmost city it had held in the Donbas region, amid a relentless Russian artillery barrage that has destroyed large parts of a city that had a prewar population of 100,000. 00:48Footage released by Russia purports to show separatist soldiers in Sievierodonetsk – video Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, acknowledged late on Sunday that “the entire critical infrastructure” and “more than two-thirds of the city’s housing stock” had been “completely destroyed”, as he asked for “more modern weapons to defend our land, to defend our people”. Nick Reynolds, a land warfare specialist with the Rusi thinktank, said: “The disparity in artillery capability is a major factor allowing the Russian ground forces to continue pushing forwards.” Russian firepower was preventing Ukraine’s forces from massing for counterattacks, the analyst said, adding that MLRS could help Kyiv by “disrupting all kinds of activity in enemy rear areas”. Last week, Ukraine’s ministry of defence released a video of what it said was the shelling of its positions by Russian TOS-1A flamethrower rockets in the Donetsk area. “Ukraine is ready to strike back. To do this, we need Nato-style MLRS. Immediately,” the ministry’s Twitter feed said. The M270 tracked MLRS, and its wheeled equivalent, the M142 high mobility artillery rocket system (HIMARS), have a far greater range than anything Ukraine can deploy at the moment. Using them could allow Kyiv to hit at Russian targets from further back, although it could expose more of its hinterland to retaliation.

The British M270 has a range of 52 miles, although 44 of the army’s stock are being upgraded to 93 miles. Last Friday Boris Johnson, the UK prime minister, said MLRS would enable the Ukrainians “to defend themselves against this very brutal Russian artillery, and that’s where the world needs to go”.

The referendum on Wednesday, in which voters backed the government’s proposal by 66.9% to 33.1%, followed historic applications by Denmark’s previously non-aligned Nordic neighbours, Finland and Sweden, to join Nato last month.  Denmark, historically critical of the EU, secured exemptions from joining the common security and defence policy (CSDP) and the euro in a 1993 referendum, but the country’s prime minister, Mette Frederiksen, said it was time to change tack. “Tonight Denmark has sent a very important signal. To our allies in Europe and Nato, and to Putin,” she told cheering supporters on Wednesday evening after the result was published. “We’re showing that when Putin invades a free country and threatens stability in Europe, we others pull together. “Denmark now can partake in the European cooperation on defence and security. And for that I’m very, very happy.” Frederiksen called the referendum barely two weeks after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, after reaching an agreement with a majority of parties in the Danish parliament, and pledged to increase defence spending to 2% of GDP, in line with Nato membership requirements, by 2033. “Nato will of course remain our most important tool, but the EU gives us another in securing our defence in the east,” the ruling Social Democrats’ defence spokesperson, Mogens Jensen, said. Eleven of Denmark’s 14 parties, representing more than three-quarters of seats in parliament, had urged voters to drop the opt-out. “The world is changing, and not in a good way. We need to stand together and strengthen the cooperation that strengthens our security,” said Jakob Ellemann-Jensen, head of the opposition Liberal party.

EU leaders Ursula von der Leyen and Charles Michel welcomed the result. Denmark’s decision was a “strong message of commitment to our common security”, Von der Leyen tweeted, saying Denmark and the European Union would benefit. “This decision will benefit Europe and make both the EU and the Danish people safer and stronger,” Michel wrote on Twitter. It would be seen largely as a symbolic win in Brussels, experts said. “The political significance will outweigh the military contribution,” said Kristian Soby Kristensen, a senior researcher at Copenhagen University’s Centre for Military Studies.

Western analysts expected a quick “shock and awe” invasion, and it seems there were indeed attempts by Russia to directly target the Ukrainian president, Volodomyr Zelenskiy, probably in order to replace his government with one more pliable to Moscow’s will. But if Putin expected a quick, easy war with little Ukrainian or international opposition – like his invasion of Crimea in 2014 – he has been disappointed. The war has resulted in sanctions against Russia, Nato membership applications from Sweden and Finland, and rising fuel and food prices in countries thousands of miles from the conflict zone. This is how it has developed in Ukraine. Phase one Invasion




Day one24 Feb
79,209 refugees
The war begins with missile strikes across the whole territory of Ukraine. Land incursions come from Senkivka, toward Kyiv, and from Crimea toward Kherson. An amphibious landing from theAzov Sea launches the bitterly contested attempt to take Mariupol. In Kyiv, Russian paratroopers make two attempts to storm the presidential compound to assassinate Volodymyr Zelenskiy.













Day two25 Feb
179,525 refugees
From central Kyiv to a rocky island in the Black Sea, Ukrainian defiance is steelier than Putin had imagined. President Zelenskiy posts a self-shot video showing that he remains in the capital, and has not accepted a US offer to evacuate. Meanwhile a small group of soldiers on Snake Island responds to a Russian order to surrender with the soon totemic response: ""Russian warship, go fuck yourself.""













Day four28 Feb
652,445 refugees
The earliest hours of the war had presaged doom for Ukraine as a squadron of Russian helicopters appeared to have taken control of Hostomel airport outside Kyiv, which would have allowed Russia to bring troops and materiel to the outskirts of the city. In fact, the operation was fiercely contested, and by day four the airport has become the front line.













Day six2 Mar
989,560 refugees
Nearly a week into the war, Russian forces manage to surround Mariupol, a strategically important port city and export hub. On the same day Russian troops assume control of the city of Kherson, giving them almost complete control of a ""land bridge"" between Crimea, annexed by Russia in 2014, and Donetsk, occupied by pro-Russian forces.





Phase two Bogged down




Day 106 Mar
1,742,688 refugees
By day 10, the main road bridge across the river Irpin, and a Soviet-era dam on the river has been destroyed, flooding a wide area to the west of Kyiv. Thousands of refugees flee across the ruins of the bridge on foot, but Russian forces are finding it increasingly hard to advance in the opposite direction.





Day 1511 Mar
2,550,041 refugees
Two weeks into the war, the Pentagon reports that a 40-mile column of Russian forces to the north-west of Kyiv has ""moved into firing positions"".  But the column is facing intense resistance from Ukrainian forces. The same day, footage emerges of a drone attack on Russian armoured vehicles near Brovary on Kyiv's eastern side.













Day 2016 Mar
3,108,406 refugees
With Mariupol still surrounded but presenting strong resistance, a Russian airstrike hits the city's main theatre, where hundreds of civilians are taking refuge. 













Day 2622 Mar
3,524,562 refugees
Ukraine says Russian forces have only three days' worth of supplies remaining, as evidence mounts that the 40-mile column has definitively stalled.





Phase three Retreat and reorientation




Day 3329 Mar
3,929,721 refugees
Russia announces during talks with Ukraine in Turkey that it will ""radically reduce military activity"" near Kyiv and Chernihiv. In fact, shelling continues, as Russia covers the beginning of its retreat from the north. In short order Russia abandons these fronts and redeploys some of the units to the eastern theatre. Ukrainian forces entering Bucha find abundant evidence of atrocities.













Day 5014 Apr
4,777,081 refugees
Ukrainian forces sink Russia's Black Sea flagship, the Moskva. Russia initially tries to claim the sinking was due to a fire and choppy seas while it was being towed to port at Sevastopol in Crimea. Ukraine says it has hit the Moskva with a Neptune anti-ship missile. It is an important symbolic victory, but the Russian naval blockade of Ukraine continues





Day 5418 Apr
4,959,759 refugees
After nearly three weeks of relative calm, during which the Russian army regrouped and repositioned, the Ukrainian government announces that a new offensive has begun in the east. Its initial strategic aim seems to be to encircle the major Ukrainian deployments on the frontline with pro-Russian separatist regions. Fierce fighting at Izyum and on the old frontline near Donetsk becomes a daily feature.





Day 5721 Apr
5,112,058 refugees
Vladimir Putin issues a public order that the Azovstal steelworks in Mariupol is to be sealed off ""so that even a fly cannot get out"", but not stormed. The compound is the last redoubt of Mariupol's Ukrainian defenders and of an unknown number of civilians. In practice, attacks continue.













Day 759 May
5,933,189 refugees
After weeks of speculation that he would use a speech at a military parade in Moscow to claim a victory in Mariupol or elsewhere, Vladimir Putin lets the occasion pass. Defenders are still holed up in the Azovstal plant, and the eastern front is making slow progress. A military flypast is cancelled ""because of bad weather"".





Phase four After Mariupol




Day 7913 May
6,094,809 refugees
Weaknesses begin to show in Russia's Donbas offensive. A plan to encircle Ukrainian forces using a pontoon bridge to cross the Siverskyi Donets river southeast of Izyum is foiled by Ukrainian defences, leading to substantial Russian losses. Meanwhile Russian forces have reportedly been forced back from the outskirts of Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city, under heavy bombardment since the beginning of the war.













Day 8217 May
6,276,834 refugees
The Azovstal defenders in Mariupol finally surrender, and are loaded on to buses by Russian forces. Ukraine says they will return as part of prisoner swaps, but some Russian officials intimate they may be put on trial.













Day 981 June
6,276,834 refugees
As the war's 100th day approaches, Ukrainian forces are under pressure in the east. Russia has identified Sievierodonetsk as its next strategic target and is battling to encircle the city; it is not clear how long the Ukrainian side can maintain contact.

Kallas spoke to reporters after President Alar Karis accepted her request to dismiss seven Centre party ministers from the 15-strong cabinet, including the foreign minister, Eva-Maria Liimets.  “More than ever, Estonia needs a functioning government based on common values,” Kallas said on Friday, according to the Baltic news agency. “The security situation in Europe does not give me any opportunity as prime minister to continue cooperation with the Centre party.” The dismissal of the Centre ministers follows weeks of political deadlock, including a vote on an education bill in which the coalition partner voted against the government and with the far-right EKRE opposition instead. “It’s honest to say that this agreement is over and we’re going to form a new coalition,” Kallas said. Kallas’s Reform party has proposed coalition talks with the rightwing Isamaa conservatives and the Social Democrats. The Centre and Reform parties have alternated in government over the nearly three decades since Estonia broke free from the crumbling Soviet Union. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has deeply concerned the three Baltic states of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, which are all EU and Nato members. Kallas said she hoped the conflict “would have opened the eyes of all the parliamentary parties to the importance of a common understanding of the threats for us as a country neighbouring Russia”. In a Facebook post, she said Estonia’s future would be secured not just by increased military spending but also “the unity of our people and the unwavering will to defend our independence”. Until a new coalition is formed, the ministers who remain in the cabinet will take over the roles of those dismissed.

After a pandemic gap of two years, the elite global summit is being rebooted in a security-drenched hotel in Washington DC, with a high-powered guest list that includes the heads of Nato, the CIA, GCHQ, the US national security council, two European prime ministers, a healthy sprinkle of tech billionaires, and Henry Kissinger. What a difference those two years have made. The western world order, which the Bilderberg group has been quietly nudging into shape for the best part of 70 years, is in all kinds of flux.  Back in 2019, the last time Bilderberg met in the flesh, the conference kicked off with the optimistic topics “A Stable Strategic Order” and “What Next For Europe?” This year however, the agenda reeks of chaos and crisis. Top of the schedule is the blandly terrifying item “Global Realignments”, followed by “Nato Challenges”, the biggest of which is obviously Ukraine. To be sure, the Washington conference is a high-level council of war, headlined by the secretary general of Nato, Bilderberg veteran Jens Stoltenberg. He’s joined at the luxurious Mandarin Oriental hotel by the Ukrainian ambassador to the US, Oksana Markarova, and the CEO of Naftogaz, the state-owned Ukrainian oil and gas company. They’ll be clinking bespoke cocktails in the Empress lounge with some of the allied war effort’s leading lights, among them Chrystia Freeland, Canada’s half-Ukrainian deputy prime minister. The summit is heaving with experts in Russia and Ukraine, including the assistant secretary of defense for international security affairs, Celeste Wallander, and ex-deputy national security adviser Nadia Schadlow, who has a seat on the elite steering committee of Bilderberg. The conference room is rigged up with video screens for shy dignitaries to make a virtual attendance, and it’s highly likely that Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskiy will Zoom in for a T-shirted contribution to the talks. Just a few days beforehand, Zelenskiy met with a Bilderberg and US intelligence representative Alex Karp, who runs Palantir, the infamous CIA-funded surveillance and data analysis company. Palantir, which was set up by billionaire Bilderberg insider Peter Thiel, has agreed to give “digital support” to the Ukrainian army, according to a tweet by the country’s deputy prime minister. The participant list is rife with military advisers, one of which is a former chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, and some hefty cogs from the Washington war machine. Among the heftiest is James Baker, head of the ominous sounding office of net assessment. Bilderberg is sometimes dismissed as a talking shop or crazed imagining of conspiracy theorists. But in reality it is a major diplomatic summit, attended this year as ever by extremely senior transatlantic politicians, from the US commerce secretary to the president of the European Council. Many consider it an older, less flashy Davos, staged annually by the World Economic Fund. The two events have a good bit in common: namely, three WEF trustees at this year’s conference, and Klaus Schwab, the grisly head of Davos, is a former member of Bilderberg’s steering committee. His “Great Reset” looms large over the Washington conference, with “Disruption of the Global Financial System” at the heart of the agenda. The conference troubles some ethicists, with politicians thrashing out an “Energy Security and Sustainability” talk with the CEOs of oil giants BP, Shell and Total. There’s also “Post Pandemic Health” with the CEOs of Pfizer and GlaxoSmithKline, who are locked away for days with Wall Street investors and no press scrutiny. Bilderberg gets scant coverage partly because of its connections to the transatlantic intelligence community. Formed in the mid-1950s as a joint project of British and US intelligence, the conference has kept its cards so close to its chest that the world’s press has given up trying to get a glimpse of them. This year’s conference lineup, led by the CIA head, William Burns, reflects those roots. Burns is a former US ambassador to Russia and was elected to Bilderberg’s steering committee just a few months before Joe Biden gave him the job, whereupon he discreetly resigned his seat. Four other active intelligence chiefs are attending: the head of the UK’s Government Communications Headquarters; the director of France’s external intelligence agency, DGSE; the leader of the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency; and Biden’s national security adviser, Jake Sullivan. Former spy chiefs at the talks include David Petraeus (CIA) and Sir John Sawers (MI6), now a board member of Bilderberg and BP. And of course, holding court at the hotel bar will be Klaus Schwab’s mentor, Henry Kissinger. Incredibly, Kissinger, 99, has been attending Bilderbergs since 1957. The prince of realpolitik has been the ideological godfather of Bilderberg for as long as anyone can remember. And he’s recently co-authored a book, The Age of AI, with Bilderberg steering committee member Eric Schmidt, the former head of Google, and this year’s Washington conference is noticeably rammed with AI luminaries, from Facebook’s Yann LeCun to DeepMind’s Demis Hassabis. Bilderberg knows that however the global realignments play out, and whatever a reset global financial system looks like, the shape of the world will be determined by big tech. And if the endgame is “Continuity of Government”, as the agenda suggests, that continuity will be powered by AI. Whatever billionaire ends up making the software that runs the world, Bilderberg aims to make damned sure that it has its hand on the mouse.",,,,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b84764cd13c80f5e15d43fb76949ad909c0abb13/0_49_4848_2909/master/4848.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=67cd9e78379a7ebbfcef9764fe4ca651

The former German chancellor also claimed that an oligarch-run and democratically immature Ukraine would have been less prepared for an invasion then than it is now.  “I would feel very bad if I had said: ‘There’s no point talking to that man [Putin]”, Merkel said in an onstage interview at the Berliner Ensemble theatre on Tuesday night – her first public appearance since leaving office half a year ago. “It is a great tragedy that it didn’t work, but I don’t blame myself for trying,” she added in an unusually frank answer from a politician who rarely spoke freely while in office. Asked about whether she regretted opposing the US-led membership action plan for Ukraine and Georgia in 2008, Merkel said: “Ukraine was not the country that we know now. It was a Ukraine that was very split … even the reformist forces [Yulia] Tymoshenko and [Viktor] Yushchenko were very at odds. That means it was not a country whose democracy was inwardly strengthened.” She said Ukraine at the time was “ruled by oligarchs”. From the Russian president’s perspective, “it was a declaration of war”. While she didn’t share Putin’s perspective, Merkel said she “knew how he thought” and “didn’t want to provoke it further”. She claimed to have blocked Ukraine’s route to membership of the military alliance with the country’s best interests at heart. “You cannot become a member of Nato from one day to the next,” Merkel said. “It’s a process, and during this process I knew Putin would have done something to Ukraine that would not have been good for it.” The Minsk agreements of 2014 and 2015 were signed by then Ukrainian president Petro Poroshenko to reach a political settlement in east Ukraine, but have since been criticised for forcing concessions while the country was militarily on the back foot. Merkel defended the accords, saying they bought Ukraine time. “It calmed down the matter and bought Ukraine time to develop into the country that it has become now.” She praised president Volodymyr Zelenskiy for his wartime leadership, saying he represented a new Ukraine. The interview with Der Spiegel journalist Alexander Osang began with Merkel talking about how she had spent her first weeks out of office going for solitary walks by the Baltic Sea, wearing a hoodie so as not to be recognised by passersby, and listening to an audiobook of William Shakespeare’s Macbeth. But the conversation inevitably turned to the war in Ukraine, and whether Germany’s alleged leniency towards the Kremlin had emboldened Putin. Merkel said she felt the geopolitical problems created by the collapse of the Soviet Union had been present throughout her 16 years in power. “It wasn’t possible to properly end the cold war … the Russia question always remained.” Merkel said she had started to take seriously the possibility of a looming invasion in her last few weeks in office, when she attended the G20 summit in Rome while Olaf Scholz’s successor government was still in the process of being formed. Germany agonises over Merkel’s legacy: did she hand too much power to Putin?Read more “There were hints and we talked about it a lot,” the 67-year-old said. “I realised that Putin had finished with the Minsk process.” While Merkel condemned Russia’s war of aggression in clear terms, she also seemed to suggest some blame needed to be apportioned to the west. “What happened is a great mistake on Russia’s behalf … an objective break with all rules of international law that allow us to coexist in Europe in peace. If we started to go through one century after another arguing which territory belongs to whom, then we would be at war non-stop. “I don’t share the opinion of Mr Putin, to make that very clear. But we didn’t manage to create a security architecture that could have prevented this [war in Ukraine]. And we should think about that too.” She rejected the criticism that Germany under her leadership had fallen for an illusion that a militarily aggressive Russia could be democratised by expanding trade links with the west. “I didn’t believe that Putin could be changed through trade,” Merkel said. But she said her belief was that if political cooperation was impossible, it was sensible to at least have some economic connections with Moscow. Merkel’s defence of expanding economic ties with Russia seemed at odds with her claiming to have warned other politicians that Putin felt animosity towards the entire western model of democracy, and that he wanted to “destroy Europe”. The former leader of the conservative Christian Democratic Union (CDU) conceded that European countries had failed to spend sufficiently on their militaries, even though she rejected criticism that the German army had fallen into disarray under her watch. “What should we have enforced more strongly?” she asked rhetorically when reviewing the decisions of her last two terms in office. “It [the military] is the only language that Putin understands. He saw that we, and not just Germany but others too, no longer had the strike power of the cold war.”",,,,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/61887bbbafabb3eb8a3c505485757b3f61aa72bb/0_85_6382_3830/master/6382.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=c48c4d1dc1292eb84570d5eeae708e28

Antti Kettunen, 44, the coach and chairman of the Vantaa Reservists Association. On 18 May 2022, Finland submitted its Nato application – a decision Kettunen has been awaiting for a long time. Although there was only about 20% support for Nato membership before Russia’s aggression, Kettunen does not know a single person who would oppose membership. Shortly after the end of the war in Kosovo, Kettunen took part in a peace mission. “You could say the mass graves were still warm when we arrived. The mission changed everything for me. Only alliances like Nato can ensure peace in the long run.” So says Kettunen when asked about Finland’s imminent accession to Nato. From late April to mid-May we – the Finnish photographer Jonathan Terlinden and German photographer Patrick Junker – travelled through Finland to visit people and places to better understand the history between Finland and Russia. Suomenlinna fortress, where even today marines are trained. A large part of the island has been a Unesco world heritage Site since 1991. The first stop on our journey took us to Suomenlinna fortress, a few miles outside Helsinki. Its construction was started in 1748 and became necessary when the Russian tsar Peter the Great tried to assert Russia as a naval power by founding St Petersburg. The fortress surrendered in 1808, and the then Swedish province of Finland became the Grand Duchy of Finland a year later and thus part of Russia. Tamara Danylova, 26, a journalist from Ukraine, arrived in Finland two weeks ago. She is living with two friends in a hostel that has been converted into a refugee shelter. She comes from Sloviansk, a city in the Donetsk region, and has supported the Ukrainian army with her family since 2014. Most recently, she lived in Lviv. But as the fighting drew closer and closer to the city, she decided to flee. Juho Moilainen, 20, is completing his military service and has come home for the weekend. He is not worried. “We have always lived here on the Russian border. Nothing has changed,” he says. As is common in rural Finland, he spends his Friday evening in the car with his friends. For the young generation, the threat of war is very abstract. Fifty years later, tsar Alexander II granted the Finns extensive autonomy. The Finnish language was promoted to weaken the influence of the Swedes and anchor the Grand Duchy in the Russian Empire. But the desire for Finnish independence grew. Only in 1917, after the October Revolution in Russia, did Finland declare independence. But Finland was a divided country. A bloody civil war between the Whites led by the conservative Finnish senate fought against the Red socialists ensued. Almost 30,000 people died in connection with the Finnish civil war. Helena Seppänen is waiting to watch the bears. She lives right on the Finnish-Russian border, in Ruhtinansalmi. “People in Russia are not evil. I have many good friends there. But if I hadn’t seen so much of Russia, I would think differently today,” says Helena Seppänen, 71, from Ruhtinansalmi, a town 450 miles north of Helsinki and a walk from the Russian border. Suomussalmi, the nearest major city, is an hour’s drive away. When we arrive here at the end of April, the days are sunny and clear. Nevertheless, the rugged lake landscape ice is still strong enough to carry cross-country skiers and ice fishers. Helena and Eero Seppänen, 77, could already see the first bears. A few weeks ago they woke up from hibernation. Before 1989, there was an invisible wall here. It was a strange situation. Now we have this invisible wall againHelena Seppänen A family portrait of Eero Seppänen, taken in 1946. He is the baby on his father’s arm and one year old at the time. Eero Seppänen has lived here all his life. His mother, Lempi, is revered as a hero in the village. She watched the first Russian soldiers cross the border on 30 November 1939. She took her three children and ran 6 miles to warn the villages and soldiers on the other side of the river. It was the beginning of the winter war and consolidated the national identity of the Finns. In this chapter of Finnish history, especially the battle around Suomussalmi, are many parallels to the situation in Ukraine today. Russian security interests served as a pretext for attacking a militarily hopelessly inferior nation. But the Finns were able to resist the overwhelming enemy in the impassable terrain and deep winter, a resistance the Soviets did not expect. They actually believed that they would free the Finnish people from the yoke of the landowners and capitalists. But the opposite was the case: the enemy’s attack and the first victories of their own military made the camps, which had been hostile to each other from the civil war, grow together. Through the “spirit of the winter war” Finland gained international prestige and internal strength. A peace treaty was reached, yet Finland had to cede territory to the Soviet Union. Although the country fought alongside Germany in the continuation war from 1941, it remained independent and free of alliances after the second world war. The Russian memorial on Raate Museum Road was erected on 19 September 1994. The statue’s base bears the text in Russian and Finnish: “To the sons of the fatherland – mourning Russia”. Veli Merentie, 98 The permanently perceived latent threat from the east forced Finland to perform an often criticised balancing act in its foreign policy in the decades after the second world war, which aimed at not provoking the Soviet Union and later Russia. During the cold war, the term “Finlandisation” was established in the west. Although neutrality was maintained, the influence of the Soviet Union was noticeable. For this reason, the country has consciously refrained from joining Nato. There has always been a lot of talk about the war in Finland. Especially since we have such an unpredictable neighbourVeli Merentie, 98 “When Putin threatened Finland and said we shouldn’t join the Nato, I changed my mind completely; of course, we should join the Nato,” says Veli Merentie, 98. “He has nothing to say about what we Finns should do.” Merentie himself took part in the continuation war, and two of his brothers died in the winter war. Finland is a country on high alert. It has always been the border between the west and east. Paavo Terä, is doing his military service in the tank brigade. He comes from a military family, and his great-grandfathers have already fought in the winter war and continuation war. “Russia already sees us as an enemy since we joined the EU. For them, we are already the frontline, they just haven’t attacked yet,” says Paavo Terä, 19, as we met him at the Arrow 22 military exercise. Unlike many other EU countries, Finland has retained its military service even after joining the EU. The Finnish armed forces have a standing strength of 34,700 and about 900,000 reservists. The armed forces regularly participate in various international exercises. In May 2022, the Finnish army was visited by forces from the UK, Latvia, the US, and Estonia to practice cooperation in the framework of Exercise Arrow 22. On the day we and more than 40 other media visited the Arrow 22 military exercise, a Russian military helicopter violated Finnish airspace. Such incidents are becoming more frequent. For example, in early April, a Russian army transport aircraft briefly entered Finnish airspace. In parallel, property is being expropriated from Russian oligarchs, and economic cooperations are terminated. Finns have become more aware that Russian oligarchs have suspect properties in Finland in recent years. Large apartment buildings and villas in strategically essential locations have attracted much media attention. Pentti Seppänen playing his accordion. Back to Suomussalmi; Pentti Seppänen, 82, has also spent his whole life close to the Russian border. The retired teacher is involved in many associations, including the Veterans Association. He was born when his mother was evacuated, and his father fought in the battle for Suomussalmi in the winter war. Yet, no matter what the politicians decide, all that matters to him is that peace is kept. “The war in Ukraine shows that the Russian government can make absurd decisions. A Finnish Nato membership probably won’t make them start thinking rationally.” ",,,,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4f84b10d4c12fb655b5a6ffa68bc2a8b86da9487/0_94_5937_3562/master/5937.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=0f64c0ead10c17a8fff566caffcc5e61

Ukraine will pay the price,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jun/12/behind-natos-defensive-shield-lies-weakness-and-division-ukraine-will-pay-the-price,"A shield deters an enemy and signifies resolve. It is also something to hide behind, in order to avoid a fight. Since Russia invaded Ukraine, the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation has been used for both purposes by US and European politicians of varying degrees of valour. But what if the shield is broken or fundamentally flawed? The western powers may be about to find out. Nato’s summit in Madrid this month is billed as its most consequential, “transformative” gathering since the cold war era. Expect much self-congratulation over how the 30-country alliance united to protect the “free world” against Russian aggression. Yet huge question marks remain.  Speaking in Poland in March, Joe Biden, US president and de facto Nato boss, set the tone. He vowed to defend “every inch of Nato territory with the full force of our collective power” – while keeping out of the war. Months later, Biden remains infuriatingly vague about long-term outcomes. Ben Wallace, the UK’s defence secretary, echoed this refrain last week in Iceland. Russia’s Vladimir Putin may target Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia next, Wallace warned, because, like Ukraine, he does not view them as “real” countries. But, like Biden, Britain has no discernible plan to ensure that an independent Ukraine survives. While many allies have stepped up, important European Nato members cower behind an alliance they previously disparaged and neglected. They use it to avoid making costly national commitments to Kyiv that might anger Moscow. Daydreaming of EU strategic autonomy, France’s Emmanuel Macron prefers talk to action. Germany’s Olaf Scholz epitomises dither and delay. Viktor Orbán, Hungary’s sanctions-busting prime minister, often seems to bat for the other side. Cynically self-serving attempts by Turkey’s troublemaker president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, to sabotage Finland and Sweden’s membership applications also undermine a united front. Jens Stoltenberg, Nato’s inoffensive secretary general, will struggle to repair these fissures. Poland and other “frontline” states want a tougher approach, including permanent positioning of additional troops, heavy weapons and planes on Russia’s borders. In response, Nato officials promise “robust and historic” decisions. As for Ukraine, its leadership has all but abandoned hopes of membership, solemnly promised at Nato’s 2008 Bucharest summit, and has ceased calling for direct military intervention. “Of course, we will hear words of support… we are very grateful for that,” said its foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba. Having previously accused Nato of “doing nothing”, he does not expect concrete action in Madrid on accession or, for example, “Black Sea security”. That last remark referred to the unforgivable, ongoing US-European failure to challenge Moscow’s illegal blockade of Ukraine’s ports, which is creating global food shortages. Nato could and should be exerting greater pressure on Russian forces, so helping persuade Putin to end his genocidal war It’s one of many areas where Nato could and should be exerting greater pressure on Russian forces, so helping persuade Putin to end his genocidal war. Why is Nato not doing more? Taken together, all the rationales and excuses for passivity and inaction produce a picture of an alliance significantly less united, powerful and organised than its admirers pretend. Initially backing Ukraine, albeit at arm’s length, gave Nato a boost. Its stock rose from the low-point of last year’s Afghan withdrawal debacle. But if, as expected, the war grinds on, if both sides grow desperate, if the diplomatic impasse deepens, and if the threat of wider conflict rises, Nato’s long unaddressed weaknesses and vulnerabilities will become both more obvious and more hazardous for those crouching behind its battlements. Its post-Soviet bluff may finally be called. It would be unrealistic to expect seamless political unanimity in so large an organisation. But the fact that each member has an equal say when, in terms of military capacity, they are absurdly unequal, hinders swift, bold decision-making. A Russian nuclear or chemical provocation, for example, would be likely to produce a paralysing cacophony of conflicting voices within Nato – and Putin surely knows it. At the same time, there is huge over-reliance on the US, a military superpower without whose agreement nothing happens and behind whose might the laggards lurk, refusing to pay their way. Organisationally and militarily, too, Nato is all over the place. It has three joint command headquarters – in Italy, the Netherlands and the US. But its top general is based in Belgium. Inter-operability of different countries’ weapons systems is lacking, as are joint training exercises, arms procurement and intelligence-sharing. Nato is also increasingly overstretched, caught between a Russian threat in the Euro-Atlantic area and challenges in the Indo-Pacific from an aggressively expansionist China. Leaders from Japan, South Korea, Australia and New Zealand are expected in Madrid. Their shared nightmare: a “no limits” totalitarian Sino-Russian global axis with echoes of the 1939 Nazi-Soviet pact. Nato is due to publish its 10-yearly “strategic concept” on how to deal with all this, plus trans-national terrorism, destabilising climate change, cyber warfare and the rise of anti-democratic states. It’s a tall order. Overdue, too, is the Biden administration’s new Asia-focused national security strategy, which had to be hastily recalibrated following the Ukraine invasion. Yet if it is to move forward effectively on these numerous fronts, Nato must also look back, admit past mistakes and accept some responsibility for the current crisis. By keeping Ukraine in membership limbo while failing to punish Putin for war crimes in Chechnya and Syria, his 2008 attack on Georgia, his annexation of Crimea and his post-2014 Donbas proxy war, complacent western leaders unwittingly paved the way for today’s catastrophe. After the Soviet collapse in 1991, Nato dropped the ball. Like football fans invading the pitch before the final whistle, they thought it was all over! But it wasn’t, and it isn’t. Right now, Putin is battering the shield, putting the west to the test. If its risk-averse approach does not change, there may soon be nowhere left to hide. Will Nato fail again?",,,,

Finland’s prime minister said on Tuesday that the two nations’ Nato applications could stall if the issue is not resolved before a vital Nato summit due to start in Madrid on 29 June.  Turkey accuses Sweden and Finland of harbouring alleged members of the Kurdistan Workers’ party (PKK) and also objects to their decisions in 2019 to ban arms exports to Ankara due to Turkey’s military operations in Syria. Turkey has gone on a public diplomacy offensive to highlight Swedish support for Kurdish groups in northern Syria that it links to the PKK – designated as a terrorist organisation in the EU, US and Turkey – and is planning to stage a fringe meeting on the issue at the Nato summit. “This is a matter of vital national interest, and we are prepared to prevent their membership for as long as a year if necessary,” said Akif Çağatay Kılıç, an MP for the ruling Justice and Development party (AKP) and chair of the Turkish parliament’s foreign affairs committee. “Turkey is the second largest army in Nato and has been providing the drones that help Ukraine defend itself. We deserve greater respect.” He said Turkey respected its own duties and responsibilities to the alliance. “What are [Sweden and Finland] going to do? They have been harbouring terrorist organisations that kill my people, disrespect my borders, pose an existential threat to my country. The only thing we demand is that there are no distinctions. A terrorist organisation is a terrorist organisation.” He denied the crisis was an attempt to fan nationalist flames before difficult elections, saying the non-Kurdish opposition parties were supportive of the stance of the president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan. He also said there was no attempt to barter with the US over arms deals. During a visit to Sweden on Tuesday, Finland’s prime minister, Sanna Marin, warned: “If we don’t solve these issues before [the] Madrid [summit], there is a risk that the situation will freeze. “We don’t know for how long but it might freeze for a while.” Jens Stoltenberg, the Nato secretary general, has praised Swedish efforts to address Turkey’s concerns, but seems to have recognised that plans for a fast-track membership may now be disappearing. The Swedish prime minister, Magdalena Andersson, is due to attend the summit, which may end up being a show of division as much as it is concerned with long-term strategic thinking and enlargement. Privately, western officials admit that Germany, France and the US are not keen to have Ukraine dominate the summit, although it is hard to imagine Nato support for Kyiv not being the central issue. On Friday Sweden tried to mollify Turkey by publishing a foreign policy paper that highlighted the need to fight terrorism, and opened a path for Sweden to resume arms export sales to Turkey. Sweden imposed restrictions on arms sales in 2019 after Turkey’s invasion of northern Syria. Britain has already lifted the sales ban. The policy paper said Sweden would “contribute to all of Nato’s security including that of Turkey”. A tougher anti-terrorism law, due to come into force on 1 July, gives the Swedish intelligence services greater latitude to monitor communications of suspected terrorist sympathisers. Although Turkish demands can vary, officials have said they want to see specific Kurdish activists deported to Turkey, as well as the sacking of the Swedish defence minister, Peter Hultqvist, over a 2011 meeting with the PKK, which has been designated as a terrorist organisation in Sweden since 1984. Ankara would like the two countries to sever ties with the US-backed Syrian Kurdish autonomous administration, which Turkey says has a synonymous leadership to the PKK. Andersson’s room for manoeuvre is limited, in that she is not going to transform Swedish extradition laws simply to satisfy the threats coming from the Turkish president, and last week she had to rely on the support of a Kurdish Swedish MP and former peshmerga fighter, Amineh Kakabaveh, to survive a narrow confidence vote. The MP says she received unspecified guarantees in return for her vote. Sweden is home to 100,000 Kurdish refugees. Turkish diplomats resent suggestions that it did not make its objections to Swedish membership earlier or that it is being hypocritical about the Kurdish issue due to its support for extremist groups elsewhere in the Middle East. Finland has fewer problems with Turkey, but has said it is unlikely to press ahead with a membership request without Sweden. Finnish media reported that the country received 10 Turkey-related extradition requests between 2019 and 2022. It granted two of those requests and is processing seven. While Britain has strong diplomatic ties with Turkey, it has also given security assurances to the two Nordic countries during the potentially dangerous grey period between their application to join Nato and the moment when full membership gives them the alliance’s collective defence protection. In an effort to find a resolution, the UK’s Europe minister, James Cleverly, is in Turkey this week to meet ministers. Angus Lapsley, the director for Euro-Atlantic security at the Foreign Office, said the UK was working night and day to try to resolve the dispute.

Russia ordered Ukrainian forces a day earlier to stop “senseless resistance and lay down arms” from Wednesday morning, as Moscow controls 80% of Sievierodonetsk, a city that has become a focal point of Russia’s advances in the east of the country.  Moscow on Wednesday also accused Ukraine of disrupting plans to open a humanitarian corridor for civilians to leave the area. The evacuation planned to bring civilians from the Azot plant to Svatove, a city north of Sievierodonetsk controlled by pro-Russian forces, and Ukraine had not publicly commented on Moscow’s proposal. More than 500 civilians, including 40 children, are trapped inside the Azot factory. Weeks of Russia’s relentless bombardment of Sievierodonetsk, including its industrial area, have reduced much of the city to rubble. The shelling of the Azot plant echoes the earlier bloody siege of the Azovstal steelworks in the southern port of Mariupol, where hundreds of fighters and civilians took shelter from Russian shelling. Saviano Abreu, a spokesperson for the UN’s humanitarian affairs office, described the situation in Azot as a “huge concern”. “The lack of water and sanitation is a big worry. It’s a huge concern for us because people cannot survive for long without water,” he told the BBC. Map: location of Azot chemical plant In its latest intelligence briefing, Britain’s defence ministry said elements of Ukraine’s armed forces as well as several hundred civilians were sheltering in underground bunkers in the Azot plant. Ukraine has not publicly acknowledged that members of its armed forces were sheltering there, and it was not possible to verify the claim. Russia continues to make gains in Sievierodonetsk, a key city in Russia’s push for full control of the eastern Luhansk region. The mayor of Sievierodonetsk, Oleksandr Stryuk, told Ukrainian television on Wednesday afternoon that Russian forces were trying to “push towards the city centre”. “This is an ongoing situation with partial successes and tactical retreats,” Stryuk said. Meanwhile, Serhiy Haidai, the governor of the Luhansk region, wrote on Facebook that 75 people had been evacuated from Sievierodonetsk, despite the three bridges that led out of the city being destroyed. “The evacuation is extremely difficult because the shelling does not subside. Police officers and volunteers were able to successfully evacuate 75 people, and all of them are safe,” he said. “We will not stop, as long as there is such an opportunity to evacuate people.” Off the battlefield, Joe Biden announced a new package of arms and ammunition worth $1bn (£825m) for Ukraine, including more artillery, coastal anti-ship defence systems and ammunition for artillery and advanced rocket systems that Ukraine is already using. In the phone call with Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, Biden said he reaffirmed his “commitment that the United States will stand by Ukraine as it defends its democracy, and support its sovereignty and territorial integrity in the face of unprovoked Russian aggression”, according to a US statement. Biden also announced $225m worth of humanitarian assistance. Meanwhile, Ukraine continued its pursuit of more European support as Nato defence ministers gathered in Brussels. “Brussels, we are waiting for a decision,” Mykhailo Podolyak, a senior adviser to Zelenskiy, wrote on Twitter. Anna Malyar, the country’s deputy defence minister, said Ukraine had received just 10% of the weapons it had requested from the west. “No matter how hard Ukraine tries, no matter how professional our army is, without the help of western partners we will not be able to win this war,” she said. In Russia, where Putin is expected to make a major speech on Friday during the annual St Petersburg international economic forum, a rare voice of public anti-war dissent emerged from Igor Denisov, the former captain of the country’s football team. “These events are catastrophic. It’s horrific. I am not sure if I will be jailed or killed for this, but I am saying it as it is,” Denisov said in an interview with a sports journalist. Denisov’s statements made him the most senior Russian former or current athlete who was still in Moscow to have spoken out against the war. His comments came as Dmitry Medvedev, Russia’s former president and a close Putin ally, further escalated his rhetoric against Ukraine, writing on his Telegram channel: “Who said Ukraine is even going to exist on the world map in two years?” It was the latest in a string of statements by senior Russian officials that questioned Ukraine’s statehood. A day earlier, Russia’s space chief, Dmitry Rogozin, called on Russia to “finish off” Ukraine “once and for all”.",,,,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8aee521a19ee4e90be7e30856929db83db0765b3/0_0_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=5b90a36534a8f3ffc5aefda0fd62afd4

It came as the new head of the British army said British troops must prepare “to fight in Europe once again”. “There is now a burning imperative to forge an army capable of fighting alongside our allies and defeating Russia in battle,” Gen Sir Patrick Sanders said, writing to his charges about the challenges they face. The statements suggest the west believes Ukraine cannot achieve a rapid military breakthrough despite the anticipated arrival of fresh Nato-standard arms, while officials in the country have continued to call for rapid help. Ukraine mourns ‘our golden generation’ killed on frontlinesRead more Ukraine’s forces remain on the defensive in the eastern Donbas region, where fighting continues in Sievierodonestsk. Serhiy Haidai, the governor of the Luhansk region, said Russia was massing forces in an attempt to take full control of the city after weeks of fighting. “Today, tomorrow, or the day after tomorrow, they will throw in all the reserves they have … Because there are so many of them there already, they’re at critical mass,” Haidai told Ukrainian television. Russia already controls most of Sievierodonetsk, Haidai said on Sunday morning, and if Ukrainian forces lose the city, fighting is expected to focus on neighbouring Lysychansk, from which 32 residents have been evacuated over the weekend despite heavy shelling. Russia’s defence ministry also said its Iskander missiles had destroyed weaponry supplied by the west in the Ukraine’s second largest city, Kharkiv, north-west of Luhansk. A Ukrainian interior ministry official said Russian forces were trying to approach Kharkiv, which experienced intense shelling earlier in the war, and turn it into a “frontline city”. Smoke and flames rise from the Azot chemical plant in Sievierodonetsk after a Russian bombardment on Saturday. Photograph: Reuters The UK’s Ministry of Defence said in a morning update that the intense fighting meant combat units from both sides were “likely experiencing variable morale”, a rare acknowledgment of the pressures faced on both sides. “Ukrainian forces have likely suffered desertions in recent weeks. However, Russian morale highly likely remains especially troubled. Cases of whole Russian units refusing orders and armed standoffs between officers and their troops continue to occur,” the ministry said on Twitter. Ukraine has been calling for a large influx of western weaponry so that it can try to push back the Russian invaders, but what has been offered so far is less than Kyiv has requested. The US, UK and Germany have promised to send 10 rocket artillery systems, but Ukrainian advisers have called for 60 or even 300. One Ukrainian official said that helping the country win a quick victory would be a saving in the long term. Oleksandr Starukh, the governor of the Zaporizhzhia region, said: “We need these weapons because winter is coming,” adding that the country would face greater economic costs if the war dragged on. Russia-Ukraine war: what we know on day 116 of the invasionRead more The problems could extend beyond Ukraine, he said, arguing that Europe could face another wave of immigrants from African and Middle Eastern countries previously reliant on grain exports from Ukraine if the war continued to disrupt maritime exports. Stoltenberg said the price of long-term support for Ukraine was justified, despite the cost of military equipment and rising energy and food prices, because the west would pay a much higher price if Vladimir Putin were to succeed and Russian forces occupied large parts of Ukraine. Johnson, writing in the Sunday Times, said the supply of weapons had to continue, and that it would be necessary to “preserve the viability of the Ukrainian state” by providing financial support “to pay wages, run schools, deliver aid and begin reconstruction”.

But he defended his predecessor Angela Merkel’s policy of seeking good relations with Moscow. Germany’s minister for economic affairs and climate action, Robert Habeck, said coal-fired power plants would have to be used more as an emergency measure to offset falls in the supply of Russian gas. Bringing back coal-fired power plants was “painful, but it is a sheer necessity”, he said. City mayors and regional governors in Ukraine say that in most cases they already face funding shortfalls and there is no money to repair infrastructure and buildings damaged in places such as Borodianka, north-west of Kyiv because government spending is focused on the war effort. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, visited the south-western frontline at Mykolaiv and the nearby city of Odesa on Saturday. He insisted after his visit that Ukraine would not cede any of the occupied territories in the south of the country to Russia, which occupies the bulk of the country’s coastal areas. “We will not give away the south to anyone. We will return everything that’s ours and the sea will be Ukrainian and safe,” he said. “Russia does not have as many missiles as our people have the desire to live.”",,,,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a6d5be658040b66136f169c2f9c2acd8d3c588c0/0_295_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=9ff9d773394862d6c8a354b20fd640e0

Photograph: Aris Messinis/AFP/Getty Images,Ukrainian troops fire a French-made howitzer at Russian positions in the Donbas region,"Sunday, 19 June 2022",2022-06-19,Ukraine is fighting a grim war of attrition. Only Nato can help change that,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jun/19/ukraine-russia-war-of-attrition-nato,"One of the primary aspirations of professional militaries is to field a force capable of delivering victory while circumventing attritional warfare. Attritional warfare develops when neither side is able to achieve a decisive advantage. Unless new capabilities or terrain shift the logic of a fight, attritional warfare ends when one side exhausts its supply of people, materiel or morale. This is the grim state of the current fighting in Ukraine. For Russia, the low morale and poor cohesion of its infantry prevents its army from undertaking large offensive manoeuvres without taking unsustainable levels of losses in both personnel and equipment. So far, it has lost about a quarter of its armoured forces in Ukraine.  Russia has therefore resorted to the saturation of Ukrainian positions with artillery, destroying defended villages and tree lines until Ukrainian troops are forced to withdraw, and then advancing to occupy what has been abandoned. This is slow and resource-intensive, but Russia has enough ammunition to keep up its current rate of fire for several years. For Ukraine, the overwhelming Russian artillery advantage means that its armed forces struggle to concentrate in formations above the company group, and making progress with such a small force demands that they commit some of the country’s best troops. Casualties among these highly proficient units has a disproportionate impact on Ukrainian military effectiveness because most of the time these veterans are distributed across the force to support less experienced troops. Ukraine, therefore, is intermittently conducting small raids when the opportunity arises, while seeking to inflict a high enough number of casualties to collapse Russian morale, enabling territory to be reoccupied. If the rate of Russian casualties can be increased, collapse is possible. The Kremlin has avoided a declared mobilisation, preferring to covertly draw people with military experience back into the ranks. This is because many Russians are actively discussing how they can avoid the draft. The very need for such measures is discussed in Russia as a sign of government incompetence, and the perception of incompetence undermines enthusiasm for the war, even among ardent Russian nationalists. If its troops become demoralised in Ukraine because of prolonged massed casualties, the Kremlin may struggle to find replacements. If the rate of Russian casualties can be increased, collapse is possible For the Ukrainians, the existential stakes in the fighting have meant that morale is high, despite their taking up to 100 casualties a day over the last couple of weeks. Ukraine has no shortage of military volunteers but it does have a shortage of equipment for them. Ukraine’s greatest immediate vulnerability is its ammunition stocks. It has almost expended its Soviet-era ammunition for key systems and is now dependent on a limited number of Nato artillery pieces. Here too, however, there is only a finite number of rounds in Nato’s stocks, which have been chronically depleted since the end of the cold war. Russia hopes that as the Ukrainians burn through the available ammunition, their capacity to resist will wither. Another challenge for Ukraine is the geometry of its current defences in the Donbas. Russian attacks to the north and south have created a horseshoe of territory still held by the Ukrainian army. After massacres of civilians by the Russian army in Bucha and elsewhere, withdrawal has become politically challenging for the Ukrainian government. But, ringed by Russian firing positions, it is exceedingly difficult for Ukraine to build up a competitive “fires capability” in the area, even if it had the guns to deploy. Russia appears to be using Sievierodonetsk as Germany used Verdun in the first world war: a point where Russia has firepower superiority but from which Ukraine cannot pull back, ensuring high and sustained Ukrainian casualties. There are several routes to ending these unfavourable conditions. If the Donbas falls to Russia, the return to a linear front may significantly reduce Russia’s artillery advantage, and if Russia then pushes into Ukrainian territory, the battlefield geometry may be reversed, as occurred north of Kyiv in the early stages of the war. Another shift from the current attritional dynamic may be caused by the provision of large numbers of long-range western artillery pieces. These, coupled with robust “kill chains”, may allow the Ukrainians to begin to destroy Russian artillery with impunity. Then Ukraine could concentrate its units and begin to press Russia’s inferior infantry hard. The other method of shifting the current logic is enabling the Ukrainians to build new combat brigades with protected mobility – armoured vehicles for carrying infantry – to enable its units to conduct concentrated attacks from Kharkiv, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia, expanding the frontage that Russia is having to defend. The problem with this is that, to be logistically viable, large numbers of vehicles of a consistent type would need to be provided. Yet Nato countries – other than the US – not only possess small fleets but have also let many of their armoured fleets become worn out and poorly maintained. Refurbishing these fleets entails time and cost, and it is not yet clear how much cost Ukraine’s international allies are prepared to bear. The final process of attrition for Ukraine is economic, and in this realm there can be no doubt that it is running out of money, while Russia can withstand western sanctions. Soon it will be essential for economic relief to sustain the government in Kyiv. Alongside the military considerations outlined above, therefore, ending the attritional struggle in Ukraine is ultimately a question of how much Nato members are prepared to invest in Russia’s defeat. If President Vladimir Putin believes that western commitment may fade in the shadow of a European recession, the risk is that he will be encouraged to grind on.

The Nordic country has built up a substantial arsenal. But aside from the military hardware, Gen Timo Kivinen said, a crucial factor is that Finns would be motivated to fight.  “The most important line of defence is between one’s ears, as the war in Ukraine proves at the moment,” Kivinen said in an interview. ‘There will be no way back’: will war change Finland’s pragmatic approach to Russia?Read more Finland fought two wars in the 1940s against its eastern neighbour, with which it shares a 1,300-km (810-mile) border. Once a non-aligned country, it is now applying to join the Nato military alliance over concerns that Russia could invade like it did Ukraine on 24 February. Since the second world war, Helsinki has kept up a high level of military preparedness. “We have systematically developed our military defence precisely for this type of warfare that is being waged there [in Ukraine], with a massive use of firepower, armoured forces and also air forces,” Kivinen said. “Ukraine has been a tough bite to chew [for Russia], and so would be Finland.“ A hundred thousand Finns were killed during the two wars Finland fought against the Soviet Union, and it lost a tenth of its territory. The nation of 5.5 million has a wartime troop strength of 280,000, with 870,000 trained as reservists. It did not abolish military conscription for males as many other western nations did after the end of the cold war. It has also built one of Europe’s strongest artillery arsenals and stocked up on cruise missiles with a range of up to 370km (230 miles). It spends 2% of its GDP on defence, a level higher than many Nato countries. It is ordering four new warships, as well as 64 F-35 fighter jets from the US defence giant Lockheed Martin. It plans to order up to 2,000 drones and deploy its own high-altitude anti-aircraft equipment, and is building barriers on its border with Russia. 82% of respondents in an 18 May poll by the defence ministry said they would be willing to participate in national defence if Finland was attacked.

Finland and fellow Nordic country Sweden are in talks with Turkey to discuss its opposition to their applications.

Nato membership would allow Finland to boost its early warning capacity by being part of the alliance’s joint airspace control, Kivinen said.

We are fighting hard to stay on the right side of history,” he said. Petkov blamed two problems for his coalition’s troubles: corrupt interests and pro-Russian influence in Bulgaria, which, he says, have “joined forces” to bring down his government.  A member of both Nato and the EU, Bulgaria has taken an unexpectedly strong pro-Ukrainian stance despite its traditional links to Russia, which prior to the war supplied about 90% of its natural gas. “We surprised everyone in Europe and we surprised Russia with these strong policies,” he said, adding that the domestic political crisis meant Bulgaria now risked a return to its “traditional role of a soft state” regarding criticism of Russia. Opposition lawmakers toppled the government coalition after it faced internal disputes over the budget and the issue of a veto on EU enlargement talks for North Macedonia. Petkov and his allies have called those issues a smokescreen, saying the crux is corrupt opposition to their anti-graft campaign. But with the collapse of the government coalition on Wednesday, after just six months in power, , one upshot will be the risk to Bulgaria’s stance against the Kremlin’s invasion, which may fall victim to the political tumult. If Petkov cannot cobble together a new coalition, he feared a “drastic shift” in Bulgaria’s support for Ukraine. “I’m afraid that it will become a much more timid, soft state on the rhetoric against the war and that some of our exports [of aid] to Poland will be sharply decreased,” he said in an interview that took place before the vote of no-confidence. “I fear that the strong stance at the European Commission and European Council level will become much more of a hedger than a strong voice against Russia.” That shift in policy is not certain, as most of his coalition voiced support for providing arms and other military-technical support for Ukraine. But Petkov said an interim government could quickly make a deal with Gazprom that would see Bulgaria agree to a rouble scheme to pay for gas and be more careful in its opposition to the war. Bulgaria’s pro-western government collapses after just six monthsRead more “Russia really wants to take down this government because it will show that if you don’t play with them, then governments fall,” he said. “It would be a great example of how the diversification strategy of gas does not work. And a less strong voice against them on sanctions and support for the Ukrainians is something they would prefer.” Petkov, who campaigned as a reformer to clean up politics, led a delegation to Kyiv to meet the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, in late April, where he hammered out a deal to repair Ukrainian heavy weapons amid internal opposition to directly supplying arms to Ukraine. He had also taken aim at the Kremlin, agreeing at one point with neighbouring North Macedonia and Montenegro to block the foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, from flying to neighbouring Serbia, forcing him to cancel the visit. Petkov said: “It was a simple decision. I took the decision that he is not flying. It’s as simple as that.” The rift over the war has put him at odds with the president, Rumen Radev, a retired general and air force commander who has said deliveries of arms to Ukraine would only lengthen the war. Petkov said the two men disagreed over the refusal to deliver Gazprom’s demand for payment in roubles, a policy that eventually led to Russia halting gas exports to Bulgaria in late April. And Radev was “very strongly against” the delivery of weapons to Ukraine via third countries. “We were very much for it,” Petkov said. Petkov, who is 42 and educated in the west, said he believed Russian propaganda had created a strong incentive for politicians such as Radev to opt for neutrality, saying he believed 20% of Bulgarians supported Russia in the war and another 60% “don’t want to take a strong stand” on the invasion. “And maybe the president is just looking at the populistic views. His personal views maybe coincide with them and he doesn’t see the same urge as we have to give leadership on these topics and to be on voice with the European members and to be as strong of a Nato ally as we can be,” Petkov said. The political crisis has more immediate triggers than the war. Issues over corruption, allegations of mismanagement and EU enlargement in the west Balkans play an important role. Petkov said that several days of mass protests showed there was strong support for his government in the street. But in the halls of power, he said, the war had further polarised sides. “The war actually showed who is on which side very clearly,” he said. “But unfortunately for the government it created more and more instability because you have to make tough decisions.”",,,,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/edb5cbdf7a39ea3abe2046d6297936dcbb61a902/0_36_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=bb1695632323aa590587372a37bb0ec4

Turkey has been trying to negotiate the terms of an escort for more than 20m tonnes of urgently needed Ukrainian grain, but Çavuşoğlu said he had not been able to secure a date for a meeting between Ukraine and Russia – a sign that an agreement on safe passage for the convoy had not been reached.  Boris Johnson in addition said the UK was willing to help with de-mining and providing insurance cover for the ships as western officials, locked in an increasingly ferocious blame game with Russia about responsibility for the grain blockade, warned the global food security crisis would last for another two years even if the war in Ukraine ended tomorrow. “Even at the best of times, if tomorrow the war was over, we are still looking at a two-year crisis globally,” one official said. Cary Fowler, the US special envoy for global food security, said at a briefing that the crisis could last three years, with some of its causes preceding the war. The western officials admitted Russia is demanding assurances about sanctions on shipping in return for allowing the grain convoys to leave the Ukrainian port of Odesa and head through the Black Sea. They pointed out that the EU had offered to provide extra letters of comfort to confirm that Russian grain and fertiliser shipments were not subject to sanctions. The EU foreign affairs chief, Josep Borrell, pinned the blame for 60% price rises in some cases on Russia, but added: “We are having a look at our sanctions in order to be sure that there is nothing that prevents exports of food and fertilisers from Russia.” The US says it has also issued general licences exempting agricultural products including food and agriculture from sanctions. Russia-Ukraine war: what we know on day 120 of the invasionRead more Truss said: “It’s very clear that Ukrainian ports must be protected. There needs to be safe passage for commercial vessels. And the United Kingdom is offering our expertise on all of those fronts to make sure that we have the measures in place so that grain can safely leave, but it is going to require an international effort.” No agreement has yet been reached on the details of how the grain convoys would be inspected to ensure they were not carrying arms for Ukraine. It has been accepted that the ships technically can safely leave the heavily mined ports by establishing safe routes through the mines. Clearance of the mines is seen as preferable, but not indispensable. Graphic Truss said on Thursday the UK supported the plan for a UN resolution to legitimise the convoy, but added: “Russia cannot be allowed to delay and prevaricate. It’s urgent that action is taken within the next month ahead of the new harvest.” The impasse has meant Ukraine’s existing silos are full and subject to attack by Russian missiles. Turkey has been offering to run a control centre in Istanbul from which the convoy operation could be jointly policed. “Putin is weaponising hunger, he is using food security as a callous tool of war,” Truss said. “He has blocked Ukrainian ports, and is stopping 20m tonnes of grain being exported across the globe, holding the world to ransom.” Failure to reach an agreement would have devastating consequences, she said, a reference to droughts already afflicting sub-Saharan Africa.

So far there has been no breakthrough, although Turkey is pleased that a special session on threats to Nato on its southern flank will be included at the Nato summit, providing an opportunity for Ankara to raise the issue. Çavuşoğlu said Sweden had provided papers to Turkey on what it was prepared to do to block the financing of the Kurdistan Workers’ party (PKK) from Sweden. The PKK has waged an insurgency against the Turkish state since the 80s and is designated as a terrorist group by Turkey, the US and the EU. The UK is a close ally of Turkey, and is trying to use its influence to persuade Ankara to shelve its objections to Swedish membership.

The UN warns this reckless maritime siege, now entering its fifth month, threatens “catastrophe on top of catastrophe” for tens of millions of the world’s most vulnerable people dependent on Ukraine’s grain exports. Yet Nato and EU leaders are visibly floundering, disunited and distracted as apocalyptic disaster looms. Questions about the west’s response to the Ukraine invasion – what weapons to send, whether Nato should act more forcibly – must be viewed in this larger context: the necessity of defending fundamental humanitarian principles upon which the UN and the global rules-based order have been based for 75 years. It’s about blameless victims of a manmade atrocity. It’s about decency, about leadership.  What Vladimir Putin is doing, right now, by weaponising staple food prices, creating artificial shortages, and risking starvation and famine among 100 million people from the Horn of Africa and the Sahel to Central America, constitutes a crime against humanity. That’s an act purposefully committed by a state as part of a systematic policy directed against civilians. There is no argument. He’s gone rogue. He must be stopped. Ideally, the Russian people would do this themselves. Yet out of fear, impotence or ignorance, most now occupy a moral vacuum where a respected country used to be. So what are Joe Biden, Boris Johnson, Emmanuel Macron, Olaf Scholz and all the other democratic leaders waiting for? Putin is mining Odesa’s waters, bombing silos and stealing grain. How many children must die horribly before they draw a line in the sea? Fear corrodes the will to act, even though rampant price inflation imperils their national interest. Soon after the blockade began, Lithuania, bravely punching above its weight, proposed a naval “coalition of the willing”, preferably under UN authority, to escort Ukrainian grain carriers past Russian warships from Odesa to the Bosphorus. It’s an entirely reasonable idea. But it hasn’t happened – mainly because Biden disproportionately fears direct Nato-Russia confrontation, because the UN security council is paralysed, and because Macron and Scholz privately oppose it. The Paris-Berlin dynamic duo, AKA the two stooges, still believe they can talk their way out of trouble by pressing Kyiv to give ground and making nice with a monster. Alternative export routes have been floated, principally expanded use of trains and lorries. But only a fraction of the 20m tonnes of grain trapped in Ukraine’s over-full silos could be shifted this way. Meanwhile, with the ripening summer harvest imminent and no place to store it, endless diplomatic exchanges get nowhere fast. The blockade was discussed at Friday’s EU summit and a special “food summit” in Berlin. It will feature at this week’s G7 and Nato meetings, too. Talk-shops are all very well. But with a heedless Russia on the rampage, concrete action is needed. That was the lesson of hapless UK foreign secretary Liz Truss’s visit to Turkey last week which, like her trip to Moscow in February, achieved precisely nothing. Recep Tayyip Erdoğan’s regime, buying missiles from Russia while claiming to be a loyal Nato partner, has been predictably two-faced since the war began. Ostensibly mediating a solution, Ankara gave a platform this month to foreign minister Sergei Lavrov, Moscow’s liar-in-chief. “The Russian Federation is not creating any obstacle for the passage of ships or vessels,” Lavrov declared without a blush. Then the silly man gave himself the lie, by suggesting grain would flow freely if sanctions were lifted. Food has become a more potent weapon in his war with the international community than either oil and gas cuts or nuclear blackmail food has become a more potent weapon in his war with the international community than either oil and gas cuts or nuclear blackmail For all the angry condemnation, Putin may be winning, at least over the blockade. Some African countries appear persuaded by Moscow’s propaganda claiming western sanctions are the problem. Putin knows the prospect of mass migration, sparked by hunger, touches a deep European nerve. In some ways, food has become a more potent weapon in his war with the international community than either oil and gas cuts or nuclear blackmail. The longer the blockade continues, the worse things will get, in terms of food emergencies and political fallout. Import-dependent Egypt and Lebanon, for example, will face intensifying unrest as bread queues lengthen. War-ravaged Yemen, where 19 million people are already food insecure, is chronically unstable. For many in drought-hit Ethiopia, Somalia, Kenya and Sudan, the outlook grows desperate. Is the west really powerless to stop this crime without making humiliating concessions? No, say analysts Bryan Clark and Bill Schneider of Washington’s Hudson Institute. If Biden and allies such as the UK were a little bolder, they suggested in an online discussion, Russia might be deterred from blocking Ukraine’s grain. Ukraine is fighting a war of attrition. Only Nato can help change that | Jack WatlingRead more Specifically, enhanced deterrence at sea could be achieved using long-range unmanned aerial systems such as US-made Gray Eagle strike drones, recently promised to Kyiv. The advanced drones, to be commanded by Ukrainians but operated remotely by contractors, carry Hellfire missiles and would enable Ukraine “to detect, track and locate Russian surface ships and if necessary sink them”, Schneider said. Increasing the Russian warships’ sense of vulnerability from the air could be enough to break the blockade without resorting to offensive action, Clark said. More sophisticated UAV capabilities could also reduce the chances of surface clashes with western escort vessels. The Black Sea fleet’s Kilo-class submarines might be similarly deterred by provision of anti-submarine warfare technology. To work, such kinetic solutions require a degree of political courage, imagination and determination so far lacking in the White House and western capitals, as symbolised by last-minute Pentagon delays in delivering Gray Eagle drones. That has to change. Putin’s starvation war is his new Holodomor for the world. The Nato and G7 summiteers must sink his blockade and send him to the bottom.

This time – after weeks during which the capital had not been attacked – Vladimir Putin doubtless aimed to fire a warning to G7 leaders gathering in Bavaria, and before a Nato summit in Madrid this week. A seven-year-old girl pulled injured from the rubble was among those who paid the price for Mr Putin’s brutal piece of symbolism. Calculated outrages such as this, and Monday’s strike on a busy shopping centre in central Ukraine, must be met with unity and renewed focus from the west. This is an ominous moment in the war. The Kremlin’s strategic refocusing of its ambitions on the eastern Donbas is now leading to significant Russian territory gains in the region. Mr Putin’s cynical blockade of the Black Sea port of Odesa is, meanwhile, driving food prices up in developing nations, creating a hunger crisis which risks being associated with western sanctions on Moscow. In the west, the politics of the cost of living crisis – in part a consequence of the war – is destabilising governments and leaders who have presented a united front since February’s invasion. Understandably, the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, fears that global repugnance at Russia’s actions since February may morph into wearied resignation and acceptance of a fait accompli in the east.  The Kremlin’s evolving long game must not be permitted to succeed. As Moscow’s aggression exacts a fearful toll on the Ukrainian population and on the country’s military forces, western leaders must seek ways to intensify the pressure on Mr Putin while continuing to ensure that Nato is not dragged directly into the war. In Bavaria, unveiling a new support package for Ukraine, G7 leaders struck the right note, pledging “financial, humanitarian, military and diplomatic support” for “as long as it takes”. Turning that rhetoric into effective action will be far from easy. Most urgently, there must be swift delivery of the defensive military assistance Ukraine desperately needs, particularly the modern air defence systems Mr Zelenskiy requested in his meeting with G7 leaders. But as Mr Putin’s regime continues to benefit from the rocketing global price of energy – compromising the effect of western sanctions – new forms of economic pressure and tactics are also needed. A suite of new measures announced in Bavaria, including higher tariffs on Russian goods, is welcome. More significant may be an emerging consensus in favour of a global cap on the price of Russian oil and gas. Such a cap would both starve the Kremlin of funding and reduce inflationary pressures on importers. Pipeline logistics would make it difficult for Moscow to find alternative gas markets in the short term. That, at least, is the optimistic scenario. But for a worldwide price ceiling to work effectively, greater buy-in from other countries around the world will be needed. This will not be straightforward. India, for instance, has ramped up imports of Russian oil since the invasion. In developing countries, an information war needs to be fought against Mr Putin’s disingenuous attempts to weaponise the Black Sea blockade. Concrete economic assistance should be delivered to these regions. To win hearts and minds for Ukraine, the west needs to show its solidarity and goodwill does not run out at the borders of Europe.",,,,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6d966f2079e7fec260fec3bdb0eaa22756425803/0_220_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=29a8d06e615fd841d3933f2643389816

Jens Stoltenberg said the military alliance’s forces in the Baltic states and five other frontline countries would be increased “up to brigade levels” – doubled or trebled to between 3,000 and 5,000 troops.  That would amount to “the biggest overhaul of our collective defence and deterrence since the cold war,” Stoltenberg said before the meeting of the 30-country alliance, which runs from Tuesday to Thursday this week. The rapid-reaction Nato Response Force currently numbers up to 40,000, and the proposed change amounts to a broad revision in response to Russian militarisation. Under the plans, Nato will also move stocks of munitions and other supplies farther east, a transition due to be completed in 2023. The Norwegian secretary general conceded he could not make any promises about the progress of applications by Sweden and Finland to join Nato, because objections raised by Turkey to their membership remained unresolved. Stoltenberg said Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, had agreed to meet the Swedish prime minister, Magdalena Andersson, and Finland’s president, Sauli Niinistö, on Tuesday in Madrid to try to resolve the issue. But he played down hopes of a breakthrough at the meeting on the margins of the Nato event. “It’s too early to say what kind of progress you can make by the summit,” he told a press conference. Turkey has said it will block the applications of Sweden and Finland unless it receives satisfactory assurances that the Nordic countries are willing to address what it regards as support for Kurdish groups it designates as terrorist organisations. Later on Monday, Andersson said still she hoped a last-minute deal could be reached, after a day of contacts between officials of the three countries in Brussels. “My strong hope is that this dialogue can be successfully concluded in the near future, ideally before the summit,” Andersson said, emphasising that Sweden “condemns terrorism in all its forms” and that the insurgent Kurdish Workers’ party (PKK) was recognised as a terror group in Sweden. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, will address the summit on Wednesday morning, where he is expected to follow on from a plea made on Monday at the G7 meeting in Germany for western countries to provide arms so the war does not “drag on over winter”. Stoltenberg said Nato would agree “a strengthened, comprehensive assistance package” for Kyiv, including immediate help to “secure communications, anti-drone systems and fuel” and longer-term assistance in transitioning from Soviet standard arms and equipment to their western equivalents. But while the state of the war is likely to dominate the summit, Nato itself will only offer non-lethal aid because its members do not want the alliance to enter into fully fledged war with Russia. Arms supplies are instead made by member states. Nato maintains eight battle groups across eastern Europe, aimed at acting as an initial frontline defence in the event of a Russian invasion. Four are in the Baltic states and Poland, and these were supplemented by the creation of four more in Bulgaria, Hungary, Romania and Slovakia after the attack on Ukraine. Germany said this month it would contribute a brigade of troops to defend Lithuania, where the country leads a 1,000-member battle group, although it emerged that the bulk of the extra 3,500 Berlin intends to contribute would be based on its own soil, ready to move farther east if needed. Stoltenberg said he expected other Nato members to make similar announcements to defend the countries for which they are responsible. Extra troop numbers would be made up by “pre-assigned forces in their home country” who would regularly exercise in the countries to which they had been linked, he added. Britain contributes about 1,700 troops to a multinational battle group it leads in Estonia. The defence secretary, Ben Wallace, said nearly a fortnight ago that it was highly likely the UK would assign hundreds more troops in support of Estonia. But Stoltenberg said there would not be a one-size-fits-all model, suggesting that not every battle group would be increased to the size of a full brigade. Canada leads the battle group in Latvia, where it contributes 700 troops, while the US is responsible for Poland. Nato released figures showing that defence spending among its 30 members was expected to increase by 1.2% in real terms in 2022, the slowest growth rate in eight successive years of growth. Nine countries are projected to exceed the 2% of GDP target, led by Greece on 3.76% and the US on 3.47% with Britain sixth on 2.12%, down marginally on the two previous years. France spends 1.9% and Germany 1.44%.",,,,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/99ae7a5f01197ce4550003268e0adb189c6e61b5/0_306_7836_4702/master/7836.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=42183994d4129577a096524b315232b9

In the battle for Donbas in the east – which has become largely an artillery duel between Russian and Ukrainian forces – Kyiv has been heavily reliant until recently on Soviet-era ammunition for the artillery that makes up a large part of its arsenal.  Now that ammunition is running desperately short, Ukraine is appealing to its allies to replace its artillery with systems that use Nato ammunition, weapons that are arriving slowly in comparison with Ukraine’s needs. “This is an artillery war now,” Vadym Skibitsky, deputy head of Ukraine’s military intelligence, said earlier this month. “We are losing in terms of artillery. Everything now depends on what [the west] gives us,” he added. “Ukraine has one artillery piece to 10 to 15 Russian artillery pieces. Our western partners have given us about 10% of what they have.” At the centre of the issue is the fact that calibres of shell used by the US and other Nato countries differ from those used in Soviet-era artillery, and are not interchangeable. Nato’s standard shells are 105mm and 155mm. Ukraine’s guns, that date back to the time of the cold war, fire 122-152mm shells. Stocks of 152mm shells tend to be held by former Soviet republics, whose ability to sell to Kyiv is complicated by continuing relationships with Moscow, while a number of African and Middle Eastern countries also hold stocks. Moscow has been running a clandestine campaign to prevent former Warsaw Pact and other countries that do have the ammunition from supplying it to Ukraine. Despite intense efforts by the Pentagon – and by private arms dealers – to find additional 152mm shells, it appears that there are now few to be had. The issue has been a defining one in Donbas in recent weeks, where it has been estimated that Russian forces are firing up to 60,000 shells a day in comparison with Ukraine’s 5-6,000. Kyiv’s troops have increasingly been forced to conserve ammunition. According to some analysts, Russia itself is facing problems with the supply of ammunition, although it has a much larger stock than Ukraine. And while Ukraine’s allies in the west have been working to supply systems compatible with Nato shells, the wholesale transformation of Ukraine’s military in the midst of a conflict is lagging behind Kyiv’s battlefield requirements.

While Ukraine is receiving systems such as the M777 155mm howitzer and longer-range multiple-launch rocket systems such as the US-supplied Himars, Ukrainian troops need to be trained to use them. “We have munitions of the new type, but we still lack guns [to fire them],” Mariana Bezugla, deputy head of the national security, defence and intelligence committee in the Ukrainian parliament recently told the Washington Post, adding that Ukraine used more of the Soviet-era shells than were produced globally in one day.",,,,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d360f2f911531b92574306355a750c40697fe8fd/0_188_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=decc40a2dd97d3bd1b8bdddbf93f7544

Australia’s new environment minister, Tanya Plibersek, has received an enthusiastic welcome in Lisbon at the UN ocean conference after flagging five new blue carbon projects and declaring that “under the new Australian government, the environment is back – front and centre”. Meanwhile, Australia’s greenhouse gas emissions increased in 2021 as the country wound back Covid-19 lockdowns without taking significant steps to maintain a fall in carbon pollution recorded during the pandemic.
The United Australia party’s new senator has accused Labor of “pumping the brakes” on the crossbench’s ability to scrutinise the government by cutting their staff, as Albanese stares down the prospect of a “Senate strike” over cuts to parliamentary staff.
Australian states and territories announced at least 23 deaths from Covid-19 on Monday.
The Victorian department of health says the Omicron BA.4/BA.5 subvariants are likely to become dominant variants in Victoria. These may be offshoots of an earlier Omicron strain, BA.2.

You do not inconvenience people. It is a disgrace the way they have been behaving today. Let’s hope the state government does what needs to be done ... and sends the fear of God into others who would carry on like anarchists.O’Brien said that “true anarchists” don’t care about policy changes on climate because “their job is to cause anarchy ... any degree of rationality won’t top it”.O’Brien said the Greens and “probably the teals” have a business model “predicated on maintaining the rage, no matter how much people try to take action on climate action” to get votes and stay in parliament.On nuclear power, O’Brien said he “hadn’t seen any evidence” that nuclear shouldn’t be considered “due to economics”. He criticised Labor for nixing nuclear due to its cost, which he said “hasn’t been proven” and argued that cost doesn’t justify a ban.He said:On the one hand we have the government calling for more gas and more coal, but Chris Bowen out there saying the solution is less of these energy sources. This crisis the country has been in is a crisis of dispatchability. The more renewables come in, the more we will need gas ... to back renewables up. It isn’t an anti-renewables debate.

AAP have filed this report from the Camp Baird base, where the prime minister visited Australian troops serving in the Middle East ahead of his week-long European trip, which includes the Nato summit in Spain before travelling to Paris. He touched down at the Al Minhad operating base in the United Arab Emirates on Monday morning local time, where he met with defence force personnel and Australian embassy staff at Camp Baird.Prime minister Anthony Albanese visits Camp Baird in the Middle East Al Minhad air base on Monday, 27 June 2022. Photograph: Lukas Coch/AAPThe base was the site where at the highest point, 2,750 Afghan evacuees were processed following the US withdrawal of Afghanistan, and the fall of Kabul to the Taliban in August last year. Speaking to about 30 troops, Albanese thanked them for their service in keeping the nation safe, and said Russia’s invasion of Ukraine was a “reminder of the unsafe world we live in”. He said:Our values of maintaining international rule of law, maintaining a sense of order in the global environment is one that can’t be taken for granted.
It does have to be defended, and those of us in political life are humbled by the knowledge that it’s defended each and every day by our men and women in uniform.Albanese spoke of a group of six young Afghan women who were living together in a house in his Sydney electorate after having been settled. “They will make great Australian citizens,” he said. He praised the women for their volunteer work in packing food hampers for those in need, and said “they will be great assets to Australia”.Australia's men and women in uniform make sacrifices to secure our national interest and keep us all safe.

About 50 Australian Defence Force personnel are serving at Camp Baird, which plays a “critical role” for Australia’s presence in the region, the prime minister said. Albanese then spoke with individual personnel gathered for breakfast at the mess, before taking a group photo with them. Australia’s ambassador to the UAE Heidi Venamore prepared a bacon and egg roll for the prime minister.Earlier, upon arrival at the base, Albanese and his partner Jodie Haydon laid a wreath at the memorial for Australians who had been killed while serving on Middle East operations.

Coaldrake said he would consider steps to ensure the ministerial code of conduct “has teeth and is observed” in his final report.Palaszczuk on Monday pre-empted his possible recommendations and announced changes to the lobbying code of conduct. She said anyone working for a lobbying firm, except for administration staff, will be deemed a lobbyist.“That basically means anyone working for a lobbying firm will need to be registered as a lobbyist,” Palaszczuk told reporters.Read more:Annastacia Palaszczuk tightens Queensland’s lobbying rules ahead of integrity report releaseRead moreUpdated at 08.05 BST 6d ago07.47Peter HannamNRMA offering voluntary carbon offset scheme for driversWe saw earlier today that Australia’s annual emissions are on the rise again for the first time since 2018. (Before that, they had fallen each year since 2009, assuming you trust the data on the land sector. There are reasons not to do so, as reported here.) Anyway, just as people can buy an offset for air travel, there are some emerging offers to do the same for motorists.One of them is NRMA’s carbon offsets scheme, which allows drivers to plug in their car make and model and their estimated annual distance driven to work out how much they should offset to be carbon neutral.They calculate the payment and will direct the money raised to bush regeneration in Australia, investing in renewable energy and rainforest protection. Hummer drivers (not me) would have a lot of trees to plant, by these calculations.@NRMOnline has launched a voluntary carbon offset program. Seems like I'll need to plant 355 trees for my *Hummer's emissions each year.

More typically, a medium-sized car driven 10,000km a year would produce about 1.87 tonnes of carbon. To take that out of the atmosphere you need to plant 84 trees (and presumably hope they survive fire, drought or water logging, etc). For that NRMA, reckons the offset will cost $41.05 – not a huge amount in the grand scheme of things.Updated at 07.57 BST 6d ago07.29It’s terrific to be back in Vietnam, on my second trip to Southeast Asia as Foreign Minister.

WWF-Australia’s Quinton Clements said the talks overall were lacking in political leadership and there was real concern that agreement would not be reached in Montreal.A spokesperson for the environment and water minister, Tanya Plibersek, said the new government was committed to “stepping up Australia’s global environmental leadership”. She said this was made clear at the Nairobi meeting and reflected in a strengthened negotiation position on environmental protection, including actions to address extinction risk and protect more land and sea area.“Australia’s negotiation team for the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity … will be advocating for an ambitious Post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework in line with the government’s commitments for stronger action on the environment.”Updated at 07.24 BST 6d ago06.52Lisa CoxAlbanese government changing Australia’s tone to be ‘more ambitious’ on environment You may have read that Australia’s new environment and water minister, Tanya Plibersek, has told the United Nations ocean conference in Lisbon that “the environment is back – front and centre” under the Albanese government.Tanya Plibersek declares environment ‘is back front and centre’ in Australia at UN ocean conferenceRead moreThese aren’t the only international talks where a change in tone from Australia has been observed.The oceans conference follows a round of negotiations last week in Nairobi for a new global agreement on nature under the convention on biological diversity.The convention on biological diversity receives less attention than global climate conferences, but the current negotiations are aimed at achieving an ambitious new international agreement for protecting and restoring nature.The significance of these talks has previously been compared to the Paris climate agreement.Plibersek was not in Nairobi last week but Australia sent a delegation. Quinton Clements, WWF-Australia’s head of policy, was among observers who noted more ambitious language from the new government.He said:There’s definitely a bit of a change from the previous regime. The new minister and government have given clearer direction to the Australian delegation. They’ve been more ambitious in terms of where Australia sits.”Clements said that ambition extended to things like halting and reversing biodiversity loss and working with other countries to ensure a “nature positive” approach to wildlife and sustainable development by 2030, which in simple terms means agreeing there will be more nature by 2030 than there is currently.Updated at 07.02 BST 6d ago06.34Omicron BA.4 and BA.5 strains likely to become dominant, says Victorian healthMelissa DaveyThe Victorian department of health says the Omicron BA.4/BA.5 subvariants are likely to become dominant variants in Victoria. These may be offshoots of an earlier Omicron strain, BA.2.In a statement, the department of health said the prevalence of BA.4/BA.5 in Victorian metropolitan and regional wastewater catchments has “risen significantly in recent weeks, indicating increasing transmission of this sub-lineage in the community”.The BA.4/BA.5 sub-lineage was first identified in catchments in April and has since risen from under 5% in late May to 17% as of 23 June, the department statement said.“BA.4/BA.5 is expected to overtake the BA.2 strain in coming weeks to become the dominant strain in Victoria,” the department said. “This is in line with similar patterns in NSW and Queensland.”Both states have seen a significant rise in the number of people hospitalised with Covid-19 during June.Victoria’s department of health said the prevalence of BA.4/BA.5 in Victoria is likely to result in an increase in cases – including reinfections – and hospital admissions and deaths. This is because the strain has a greater ability than BA.2 to evade immunity provided by vaccination and earlier Covid-19 infection.There is no evidence at this stage that the BA.4/BA.5 sub-lineage causes more severe disease, but the department is closely monitoring the situation.The department statement urged people to stay up to date with vaccinations, stay home if unwell, and strongly recommended masks be worn in shared indoor settings.Updated at 06.42 BST 6d ago06.14Nino BucciTjapwurong woman withdraws legal challenge to Victorian highway after state says it will develop new planA senior Tjapwurong (Djab Wurrung) woman who has withdrawn a legal challenge to the construction of a highway that endangered culturally significant trees in western Victoria says the court case represents a win for her community.Marjorie Thorpe said in a statement that she had withdrawn the challenge after the state government’s Major Road Projects Victoria (MRPV) agreed it would no longer rely on a 2013 cultural heritage management plan as part of its Western Highway duplication project.In October 2020, MPRV felled a tree considered a sacred directions tree, Thorpe said, and were preparing to destroy another tree and build the road close to five other significant trees, including two birthing trees.Thorpe filed an emergency supreme court application soon afterwards, and an injunction preventing further roadworks until the case was heard was granted later that year.Thorpe said that as the court case continued the state “abruptly announced that it would no longer rely on the 2013 plan to construct the road, and promised to work with the Eastern Maar Aboriginal Corporation to develop a new Cultural Heritage Management Plan”. She said this meant there was no need for the case to continue. Thorpe added:This week, in a win for my Tjapwurong community and ancestors, I discontinued the proceeding.
This maintains my rights to sue if the state tries to use the old Cultural Heritage Management Plan as a basis for further construction on our lands.
It also reserves my rights to review the new Cultural Heritage Management Plan once is it complete to ensure it is legal and complies with cultural heritage legislation.Thorpe thanked community members who gave evidence in her case, and her lawyers, and urged the state to better protect Aboriginal heritage. She said:Tjapwurong people have lost many of our stories about the trees as a result of colonisation and dispossession, but that makes the surviving stories of special importance.
They provide a connection to our past – an important connection to the existence and history of the Tjapwurong people. It is important that we preserve that connection, including so we can pass on the stories of our ancestors and our people and the land to our children and grandchildren.
I hope that this time around, the rights of our people and the remains of this precious heritage can be protected.Updated at 06.26 BST 6d ago05.48Adam MortonAustralia’s emissions climbed in 2021 as transport and fossil fuels wiped out gains during CovidAustralia’s greenhouse gas emissions increased in 2021 as the country wound back Covid-19 lockdowns without taking significant steps to maintain a fall in carbon pollution recorded during the pandemic.National emissions rose 0.8% – 4.1m tonnes of carbon dioxide – in the final full year of the federal Coalition government, according to government data released on Monday.While pollution from electricity generation continued to drop due to an increase in renewable energy and reduction in coal power, this decrease was effectively cancelled out as emissions from transport, manufacturing and fossil fuel developments – notably the gas industry – bounced back.Emissions were also up from agriculture as the recovery from drought continued.Read more:Australia’s emissions climbed in Coalition’s final year as transport and fossil fuels wiped out gains during CovidRead moreUpdated at 05.52 BST 6d ago05.27The Teacher’s Pet podcaster tells court he wanted justice for Lynette DawsonThe journalist behind The Teacher’s Pet podcast has told a court he wanted justice for Lynette Dawson, believing she had been killed by her husband in January 1982.Giving evidence in the murder trial of Christopher Michael Dawson on Monday, The Australian’s Hedley Thomas said he had produced the 2018 podcast to help Lynette Dawson’s family seek justice for their daughter and sister who had vanished with no explanation.“And so justice for Lyn meant to you, didn’t it, the prosecution of Christopher Dawson,” asked defence barrister Pauline David.“I think that is a fair call, yes,” Thomas replied.Read more:The Teacher’s Pet podcaster tells court he wanted justice for Lynette DawsonRead moreUpdated at 05.31 BST 6d ago05.03National Covid summaryHere are the latest coronavirus numbers from around Australia today, as the country records at least 23 deaths from Covid-19:ACT

The cost of generation also varies a lot across different parts of Australia, depending on their energy mix. The ASX tracks future wholesale prices, and Victoria is projected to have a cheaper prices for the next few years at least (partly because their brown coal is not internationally traded).Meanwhile, here's how the ASX futures suggest wholesale power prices are going to trend over the next couple of years.

As for the future, we will get a better sense of what the Australian Energy Market Operator expects will be the necessary new investment “to keep the lights on” when it releases the 2022 Integrated System Plan this Thursday. We know from the draft plan – and last week’s release of the design of a capacity market – that a massive amount of spending is going to be needed over the next few decades. Expect some big numbers but it is also worth remembering that we would have had to spend most of it even without a decarbonising goal since all of the coal plants and some gas ones are at or approaching the end of their design lives anyway.As one energy insider said the other day: “How often do you see somebody driving a 50-year-old car?”Updated at 04.46 BST 6d ago04.22Police vow to crack down on Sydney protesters as 11 arrestedPolice have accused environmental activists who staged disruptive protests in Sydney on Monday of “incredibly dangerous” behaviour and have vowed to continue tracking down all of those involved ahead of further actions planned this week.A woman who locked herself to the steering wheel of her car and blocked the harbour tunnel was one of 11 climate protesters arrested in Sydney, as Blockade Australia activists kicked off a week of disruption with a march through the city centre.On Monday afternoon, the acting assistant commissioner, Paul Dunstan, said those involved will be charged with recently introduced state government legislation to crack down on illegal protesters following several arrests of climate change activists blocking traffic and access to ports. Protesters face a maximum penalty of two years’ jail and $22,000 fines for disrupting traffic or preventing access on roads.Dunstan said police will continue going through CCTV footage to identify protesters so they can be arrested. He also said police will have an increased presence across the city in coming days in anticipation of further actions. Police will continue to be out in force in the coming days as this group continues their unlawful disruption of Sydney. They appear hell-bent on continuing this activity to disrupt the people of our city ... We need the public’s help to help us identify those involved and to help us prevent further unlawful protest activity.Dunstan said police had a “very strong deployment on the footprint of the CBD” on Monday, “however, the group this morning was highly unorganised and erratic, and they were moving throughout the CBD in an unstructured format, and it was difficult to get ahead of them”.We will be out in force and we will have additional police as a result of this morning’s activity. What I will say – the behaviour of this group was nothing short of criminal activity. The throwing of bicycles, the throwing of garbage bins, the throwing of other items in the path of police, in the path of media, in the path of innocent members of the public just walking by, will not be tolerated and cannot be by the people of NSW.Read more:Blockade Australia protest: 11 activists arrested as car rams into protesters in Sydney CBDRead moreUpdated at 04.29 BST",/p/ymxz4,2035.0,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2022/jun/27/australia-news-live-update-albanese-madrid-nato-summit-crossbench-health-economy-victoria-nsw-qld-labor-coalition-dutton#comments,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cc30abfc1aa064ab8bfbdf8a8c9e2c5859f446b9/0_0_4495_2697/master/4495.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=b1fd61d4d5f058da630880f52677dd3d

In an interview with German media following the G7 summit in Schloss Elmau, the prime minister cited the Russian president’s gender as a contributory factor to the conflict.  Johnson told broadcaster ZDF: “If Putin was a woman, which he obviously isn’t, if he were, I really don’t think he would have embarked on a crazy, macho war of invasion and violence in the way that he has. “If you want a perfect example of toxic masculinity, it’s what he is doing in Ukraine.” It comes after western leaders ended the three-day G7 summit in southern Germany promising to increase the economic and political costs to Putin and his regime of Russia’s war in Ukraine. Johnson has since travelled to Madrid for a Nato summit along with the foreign secretary, Liz Truss. The British military presence in Estonia will be bolstered as Nato dramatically escalates its ability to respond to Russia. Leaders from the 30-member alliance will agree to cooperate more closely and significantly increase the number of troops held at high readiness. The UK already has a significant military presence in Estonia and the prime minister will use the meeting to expand its headquarters in the Baltic nation. Officials said it would ensure the UK could provide rapid reinforcements if needed and deploy artillery, air defence and helicopters. The alliance plans to have 300,000 troops at high readiness – up from the current 40,000 – and the UK will commit capabilities in land, air and sea to the “new force model”.",,,,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d805fd42405cbda5cf1c3668695aab30abf3738d/0_167_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=53a47a3492bc6379fea66f1db86c165e

Nato said a trilateral deal had been reached at a meeting between Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, President Sauli Niinistö of Finland and the Swedish prime minister, Magdalena Andersson, in the Spanish capital.  After a period of intensive negotiations, Jens Stoltenberg, Nato’s secretary general, said on Tuesday evening: “I am pleased to announce that we now have an agreement that paves the way for Finland and Sweden to join Nato.” “Turkey, Finland and Sweden have signed a memorandum that addresses Turkey’s concerns, including around arms exports and the fight against terrorism,” he added. Map Andersson hailed the deal as a “very good agreement”, rejecting claims that she had conceded too much to Erdoğan in order to persuade him to drop his veto. “Taking the next step toward a full Nato membership is of course important for Sweden and Finland. But it’s also a very important step for Nato, because our countries will be security providers within Nato,” she told Agence France-Presse. Andersson said she had shown the Turkish leader changes in Sweden’s terrorism legislation set to come into force next month. “And of course, we will continue our fight against terrorism and as Nato members also do so with closer cooperation with Turkey,” the Swedish premier said. Sweden and Finland had historically declined to seek Nato membership, partly because of mixed public opinion and caution around their security relationship with Russia. But that dramatically changed after Russia launched an unprovoked attack on Ukraine in February, prompting both countries to ask to join. It means the Swedish and Finnish leaders will be able to attend the Nato summit on Wednesday and Thursday as invitees, meaning that their countries are on a firm path to full membership, subject only to ratification by member states. That is considered a technical step. Turkey had said it would block the applications of Sweden and Finland unless it received satisfactory assurances that the Nordic countries were willing to address what it regards as support for Kurdish groups it designates as terrorist organisations, in particular the Kurdistan Workers’ party (PKK). Because Nato operates by consensus, it is possible for one country in the 30-strong military alliance to block an application, giving Ankara leverage when the two countries sought to join earlier this year. 04:05'A dangerous neighbour': why Finland and Sweden want to join Nato – video explainer Turkey said it was satisfied with the outcome. “Turkey has made significant gains in the fight against terrorist organisations,” said a statement released by Erdoğan’s office on Tuesday, adding: “Turkey got what it wanted.” The text of the memorandum signed by all three leaders says that Finland and Sweden will “extend their full support” to Turkey in matters of national security. The Nordic countries said they confirmed that the PKK was a proscribed organisation and, in a key concession, would “not provide support” to the Syrian Kurdish Democratic Union party (PYD) and People’s Protection Units (YPG) groups that have been active in the fight against Islamic State in Syria. Finland and Sweden affirmed in the deal there were no national arms embargoes relating to sales to Turkey and all three countries said they would work together on extradition requests. Sweden is home to 100,000 Kurdish refugees and Turkey has called for the extradition of individuals it says are linked to the PKK or the Syrian YPG. Stoltenberg said Finland and Sweden had agreed to a “further amending their domestic legislation” to give Turkey the anti-terror reassurances it had sought, and would be “cracking down on PKK activities” and “entering into an agreement with Turkey on extradition”. US president Joe Biden congratulated the three countries on securing the deal, which he described as “a crucial step towards a Nato invite to Finland and Sweden, which will strengthen our alliance and bolster our collective security.” Boris Johnson greeted the announcement by tweeting: “Fantastic news as we kick off the Nato Summit. Sweden and Finland’s membership will make our brilliant alliance stronger and safer.”",,,,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bc8487b8b761db36309da551a7343332ab6c9606/0_425_6904_4143/master/6904.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=cfcf9b40b74a7ad1c78e931a40cc0599

Liz Truss, the foreign secretary, who is joining the prime minister at the Nato gathering in Madrid, was most explicit, calling for faster action to help Taiwan with defensive weapons, a key requirement for Ukraine since the invasion.  “There’s always a tendency – and we’ve seen this prior to the Ukraine war – there’s always a tendency of wishful thinking, to hope that more bad things won’t happen and to wait until it’s too late,” Truss told the Commons foreign affairs committee. Her words went well beyond the standard government language on the issue. “We should have done things earlier, we should have been supplying the defensive weapons into Ukraine earlier. We need to learn that lesson for Taiwan. Every piece of equipment we have sent takes months of training, so the sooner we do it, the better.” Johnson has been more wary about referring to China directly, but in comments on Monday likening the need to support Ukraine with the second world war, he said the impact of allowing a Russian victory would “also be felt in east Asia”. On his plane as he travelled from the G7 summit in southern Germany to Madrid, Johnson was asked by reporters about the comment and whether Taiwan needed more support. “I just think it’s very important that countries around the world should not be able to read across from events in Europe and draw the conclusion that the world will simply stand idly by if boundaries are changed by force,” he said. “That’s one of the most important lessons that we pick up from Ukraine.” Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BST Taiwan has governed itself since nationalist forces fled to the island after the Communist party took control of China in 1949.

At the Commons hearing, Truss also promised MPs she would come up with a standalone foreign policy strategy for relations with China. “I am very happy to go away and look at this. I am very clear we have a China strategy which I am currently implementing in everything I do, but in terms of a written document I will go away and look at that,” she said.",,,,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c17fc5edcd5279989d39ff851957138f928ba080/0_208_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=d9424d76ec116f3932dd197a1029081a

In a chaotic sequence of events, a senior government source said there needed to be “a reality check” on the pledge to increase the defence budget each year by 0.5% above inflation, only for Johnson to try to argue it would be achieved.  Speaking to reporters as he travelled from the G7 talks in southern Germany to Madrid, where the agenda will again be dominated by the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the prime minister also pointedly dodged questions on whether he supported the idea of increasing defence spending to 2.5% of GDP by 2028. A leak overnight had suggested that Ben Wallace wrote to Johnson asking for this commitment, although the defence secretary said on Tuesday he had not put a figure on his demands in private. Liz Truss, the foreign secretary, said she agreed with the idea. Both ministers are at the Nato summit with Johnson. On Monday, it emerged that No 10 had been warning it would most likely ditch the 0.5%-plus-inflation target, with the inflation rate above 9% and expected to rise. A senior government source said there was a need for “a reality check on things that were offered in a different age”, also citing the money spent on Covid measures. Asked about the comments, Johnson insisted the pledge would be met – but in terms that appeared to differ some way from the manifesto pledge, which simply said that as well as spending at least 2% of GDP on defence, the government would “increase the budget by at least 0.5% above inflation every year of this parliament”. Johnson said this target would be met if inflation is measured over the long term, not annually. “We have been running way ahead of that target for a while now,” he said. “We’re confident we will beat that this year. You don’t look at inflation as a single data point, you look at it over the life of the parliament, and we’re confident that we’ll make that.” Asked whether he supported the idea of a 2.5% target, Johnson avoided the question, referring only to “record” existing levels of defence spending. The wider row over the defence budget risks causing a rift with Wallace. While he has not spoken publicly about a 2.5% target, in a speech in London on Tuesday he hit out at cost cutting, saying the British military had for too long had to survive on “a diet of smoke and mirrors, hollowed-out formations and fantasy savings”. In a speech to a military conference organised by the Rusi thinktank, Wallace made it clear he felt the military required extra money. “If governments have historically responded every time the NHS has a winter crisis, so must they when the threat to the very security that underpins our way of life increases,” he said. “Sometimes it is not about what dividend you can take out, but about what investment in people and equipment you can put in.” Defence sources said there was no immediate concern about budgets during the period of the current spending review, up to April 2025, given that the budget would remain at above 2% of GDP, but pressure remains for increases in spending in the years thereafter. Appearing before the foreign affairs select committee on Tuesday, Truss was more explicit still when asked if she backed the 2.5% idea. “I agree with [Wallace’s] concerns,” she said. “The free world did not spend enough on defence post the cold war and we are now paying the consequences. I support the aims of increasing defence spending through Nato.” Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am While senior military staff are necessarily more measured in their words, Gen Sir Patrick Sanders, the new head of the army, hinted in a speech on Tuesday that Britain would have to spend more on defence in response to Russian aggression. The chief of general staff said the British army had to mobilise “to prevent war”, arguing that the military faced a “1937 moment” in which it had become necessary to modernise and adapt “to meet today’s threat”. The shadow defence secretary, John Healey, said Johnson was “breaking his defence pledges to the British public”. He added: “With threats increasing and rising Russian threats, ministers must reboot defence plans and halt army cuts now.” Johnson also said there would be conversations in the Spanish capital about the idea of increasing the Nato-wide target from 2% of GDP to 2.5% even though a majority of members have not met the current target. “It was the UK that brought in the idea there should be a 2% floor,” the prime minister said. “We will have to have a conversation at Nato about where we go next. That’s something we will be talking about with friends and colleagues.”",,,,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/125503445b7c571adbc5341d7989734bc556bc52/1006_606_3046_1828/master/3046.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=aa65da1cbbd9dcc1e5dbc3ea8d35d2d5

About 18 people are believed to have been killed. Military personnel, volunteers, firefighters and police have been working non-stop to recover bodies from the rubble. Authorities estimate there were between 200 and 1000 people inside the mall that afternoon. Zelenskiy described the attack on Kremenchuk as “one of the most defiant terrorist attacks in European history”. “A peaceful city, an ordinary shopping mall with women, children, ordinary civilians inside,” he said. “Only totally insane terrorists, who should have no place on earth, can strike missiles at such an object. And this is not an off-target missile strike, this is a calculated Russian strike – exactly at this shopping mall.”  A map showing the location of the shopping centre in Kremenchuk The leaders of the G7 said Russian president Vladimir Putin’s attacks aimed at civilians were a “war crime” and condemned the “abominable attack” in Kremenchuk. “We stand united with Ukraine in mourning the innocent victims of this brutal attack. Indiscriminate attacks on innocent civilians constitute a war crime. Russian president Putin and those responsible will be held to account,” a statement read. They said they would “continue to provide financial, humanitarian as well as military support for Ukraine, for as long as it takes”. British government minister Chris Philp said that the strike was “terrorism” and illustrated there was “no end to Putin’s barbarity”. He said that it was “part of a consistent pattern of atrocities being committed by the Russian government”. Russia’s ministry of defence has claimed that the fire in the shopping mall in Kremenchuk was caused by “the detonation of stored ammunition for western weapons”. No evidence was offered to back up the claim. 00:58Rescuers search wreckage of Ukrainian shopping centre for bodies and survivors – video Kherson’s mayor, Ihor Kolykhaiev, was arrested by Russian forces on Tuesday, according to an adviser to the mayor. Galina Lyashevskaya posted to Facebook that Kolykhaiev had visited a utility facility, then when leaving a car was immediately detained by armed national guards, “most likely the FSB”. Lyashevskaya said hard drives were seized from computers, safes were opened, and guards searched for documents. During this time, she wrote Kolykhaiev was kept in a separate office, and handcuffed in the presence of armed guards. After the search, Lyashevskaya said the mayor was put “on the Z bus and taken away”. Russian shelling of a residential area in Ukraine’s second largest city, Kharkiv, killed at least five civilians on Monday, the regional governor said. A further 19 people were wounded in the attack, Oleh Synehubov said. A Russian missile attack also killed at least eight civilians and wounded 21 in Ukraine’s eastern Lysychansk region. “Today, when the civilian people were collecting water from a water tank, the Russians aimed at the crowd,” Serhiy Haidai, Luhansk governor, said on Telegram. During a visit to Turkmenistan, Russia’s foreign minister Sergei Lavrov has said the more western countries send weapons to Ukraine, the longer the conflict will last. Russian forces are being increasingly hollowed out, have degraded combat effectiveness and only achieved tactical success at Sievierodonetsk despite fielding the core elements of six different armies, according to the latest UK Ministry of Defence intelligence briefing. The US state department has spoken by telephone to an Alabama man who was recently captured in Ukraine while voluntarily helping the country’s armed forces fight Russian invaders, according to his family. Alexander Drueke told the state department that “he is OK, receiving food and water and has shelter and bedding”, Dianna Shaw, his aunt, said late Monday. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said there can be no return to prewar ties with Russia. Scholz said that with its attack on Ukraine, Russia has broken “all the rules, all the agreements we have made with each other on countries’ cooperation” after the G7 summit. He said G7 leaders agree that it has led to long-term changes “which will mark international relations for a very, very long time. So it is clear that, in relations with Russia, there can be no way back to the time before the Russian attack on Ukraine.” The UN security council will meet on Tuesday to discuss Russia’s targeted attacks on civilians at the request of Ukraine. Nato will boost the number of troops on high alert by more than sevenfold to over 300,000 in response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Nato’s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, said the military alliance’s forces in the Baltic states and five other frontline countries would be increased “up to brigade levels” – doubled or trebled to between 3,000 and 5,000 troops. That would amount to “the biggest overhaul of our collective defence and deterrence since the cold war,” he said. Zelenskiy has said of the Nato summit in Madrid this week that he has spoken to secretary general Jens Stoltenberg. Turkish president Tayyip Erdoğan said he would meet US president Joe Biden at the Nato summit this week and discuss what he said was Washington’s “stalling” of Ankara’s request to purchase new F-16 fighter jets. Erdoğan also said Finland and Sweden must take Turkey’s concerns into consideration and deliver not only words but results if they wanted to be Nato members. UK defence secretary, Ben Wallace, has reportedly written to the prime minister to call for the defence budget to be lifted to 2.5% of GDP by 2028. The leaked request, first reported by Talk TV, emerged on the eve of the Nato summit in Madrid, which will discuss the renewed threat posed by Russia and the anticipated commitment of hundreds more British troops to the defence of Estonia. Any encroachment on the Crimea peninsula by a Nato member-state could amount to a declaration of war on Russia which could lead to “World War Three,” Russia’s former president, Dmitry Medvedev, was quoted as saying on Monday. “For us, Crimea is a part of Russia. And that means for ever. Any attempt to encroach on Crimea is a declaration of war against our country. And if this is done by a Nato member-state, this means conflict with the entire North Atlantic alliance; a World War Three. A complete catastrophe,” Medvedev told the Russian news website Argumenty i Fakty. The US is planning to buy and send more medium- to long-range missile systems to Ukraine, including Nasams, an advanced surface-to-air missile system, according to defence officials. The US national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, confirmed on Monday the US is in the process of finalising a package that includes advanced air defence capabilities. Putin and his Brazilian counterpart, Jair Bolsonaro, discussed global food security and confirmed their intention to strengthen their strategic partnership, the Kremlin said on Monday. Putin assured Bolsonaro in a phone call that Russia would fulfil all its obligations to supply fertilisers to Brazil, the Kremlin said in a statement as reported by Reuters. ",,,,

The message is one of Russia’s indifference to condemnation of its crimes. Moscow will not back down. And that in turn may be based on confidence – whether sound or misguided – that over the long term the war is going Russia’s way. Russia has been making gains. Its eastern Ukraine offensive slowly grinds forward by destroying everything in its path, and there is a growing realisation in the west that there will be no early end to the conflict. But the war is dragged out even further by Russia successfully deterring Ukraine’s western backers from providing it with the weapons systems it needs – including more ammunition, drones, jammers, radars, and means of intercepting Russia’s long-range missile strikes like the ones seen over recent days.  Military support to Ukraine from the US, the UK and their allies has incrementally expanded in scope, taking on more powerful offensive systems such as longer-range artillery. But the biggest constraint on providing Ukraine with war-winning equipment is still the fear of how Russia will respond. Critics of the current level of western support say this restraint is an example of the US and others self-deterring, out of fear of provoking escalation. But the reality is far simpler. Russia-Ukraine war: 21 people missing after shopping centre attack; G7 leaders agree to explore Russian oil price cap – liveRead more Russia’s continuing campaign of threats and bluster is having the intended effect: causing Moscow’s adversaries to hesitate. The pervasive notion that provoking Russia would lead to disastrous consequences is a key victory for Moscow. Successfully dissuading the west from providing Ukraine all the support it needs to turn the tide of the war confirms once again for Vladimir Putin that Russia’s military inferiority to the west can be overcome through leveraging western fear. In fact, the west’s clearly stated fear of escalation proves to Russia that threats work, regardless of how implausible they may be or how often they have been shown to be empty. By now it’s a tediously repetitive cycle of promises of nuclear annihilation for whoever has most recently upset Russia’s propagandists – for example Russian state TV recently discussed attacking the Netherlands. Russia’s nuclear threats will continue for as long as they are effective in preventing Ukraine being provided with war-winning military support. The G7 may have made the right noises about support for Ukraine continuing “for as long as it takes”, but Ukraine’s biggest challenge remains trying to persuade its international backers to match words with deeds. In addition there is a striking mismatch of aims and priorities between the two sides. While Russia has clearly laid out what it wants from the war – the extinction of Ukraine as an independent nation and the restoration of Russian imperial power over its neighbours – Ukraine’s western backers are confused and divided over how they want the war to end, and what they want to happen to Russia as a result. All of this buys Russia time. President Zelenskiy has told the G7 he wants the war to be over by winter. There’s a good reason for that deadline. Europe is still far from weaning itself off Russian energy, and a painful winter of even higher fuel prices will drive home for Europeans the true cost of supporting Ukraine in this conflict. But it’s not just energy that Russia can exploit to induce third countries to argue for peace at Ukraine’s cost. Food blackmail of the rest of the world through Russia’s naval blockade is another tactic bringing success – Ukraine has claimed that it is under pressure to surrender from states in Africa and Asia who are alarmed at their grain supply being cut off. Russia is also suffering the costs of its war, in the form of fallout from economic sanctions. But the degradation of Russia’s economy and industry will not take place fast enough to influence the short-term progress of the conflict. ‘The enemy is planning something’: Kharkiv fears new Russian attackRead more In military terms too, Russia may be able to outlast Ukrainian resilience and western patience. Authoritative assessments say Russia is running out of trained military manpower. But as with so much else, this is a less definitive challenge for Russia than it would be for other powers. Traditional Russian indifference to the scale of casualties incurred in pursuit of war aims is manifesting in its willingness to throw half-trained or untrained reserves and levies into the fight, including those drafted by force from occupied territories (yet another war crime to add to Russia’s catalogue). It is these larger forces of economic, military and political power that will determine the outcome of the war, not individual operations’ success or failure – such as the capture of Severodonetsk, which has transfixed western audiences for weeks. Russia seems confident in where that balance of power lies. Ukraine’s own forces remain committed to the fight. But for that to continue, they must remain convinced that they have a reasonable chance of success in preventing Russian victory. Each refusal by western partners to provide the means to hold or regain Ukrainian territory makes that chance recede a little further. For as long as Europe and the US are hesitant and reticent about providing Ukraine with the weapons it needs to bring the conflict to a conclusion – or at the very least to inflict sufficient damage on Russia’s forces that Putin‘s perception of winning is finally challenged – it is hard to see how any swift end to the war will go in Ukraine’s favour. In the meantime, the savage attacks on civilians and essential infrastructure in Ukraine will continue.

The prime minister met with his Spanish counterpart, Pedro Sánchez, on Tuesday in Madrid before the Nato summit, marking the first bilateral visit by an Australian prime minister.  Albanese said the “very warm and productive meeting” lasted for more than a hour, but discussions about a trade relationship “essentially stalled”. Malaysian foreign minister says concerns remain about Aukus pact after meeting with Penny WongRead more “It was clear that there were two impediments,” he said. “One was the Australian relationship with France and the breakdown that had occurred in recent times given France’s leadership role in Europe. “The second was Australia’s position on climate change, where the perception by Europe and indeed by the world, [was] that Australia was a handbrake on global action. “Australia just wasn’t seen as being fair dinkum about taking action on climate change.” Albanese said the perception had hindered Australia’s capacity to enter into economic relationships with European countries. “The EU trade deal is critical,” he said. Albanese said he hoped to see an “acceleration” in progress over the coming months, with a number of European trade ministers due to visit Canberra for discussions. Later this week, he will visit Paris at the invitation of the French president, Emmanuel Macron, in an effort to repair the relationship, after Australia dumped a $90bn submarine deal with Naval Group.

Saifuddin told reporters he communicated Malaysia’s ongoing concern about the security deal between Australia, the UK and the US during a “very candid” discussion with Wong on her first visit to the Malaysian capital as Australia’s foreign minister.  Regional objections to Australia’s planned acquisition of nuclear-propelled submarines surfaced almost immediately after Aukus was unveiled by Joe Biden, Boris Johnson and Scott Morrison. It is clear Australia’s voice is being heard in the region – and that’s in no small part due to Penny Wong | Katharine MurphyRead more Saifuddin and Indonesia’s foreign minister, Retno Marsudi, pointed to the risk of a regional arms race at a time of increasing tensions in the East and South China Seas. Last November, the Morrison government deployed then foreign minister Marise Payne to Malaysia, Vietnam and Indonesia in an effort to smooth over tensions. Since being sworn in just over a month ago, Wong has embarked on a diplomatic offensive in the region to reset relationships disturbed by Aukus and to counter increasingly assertive regional outreach by China in the Pacific. Asked on Tuesday whether or not his negative view of Aukus had ameliorated since the unveiling of the pact last September, Malaysia’s foreign minister said: “Malaysia highly values regional peace and security of the Asean region.” “We want to maintain the South China Sea in particular and the region as a whole as a region of peace, of commerce, of prosperity. “We had a very candid discussion on Aukus just now and I thank [Australia’s] foreign minister for explaining the government’s position. Malaysia’s position remains the same. I have mentioned that to the foreign minister.” Wong said she appreciated the opportunity “to explain how we see Aukus to [Saifuddin] and to other counterparts in the visits I have made prior to this visit, which are obviously to Vietnam and to Jakarta”. In early June Wong travelled to Jakarta with Australia’s prime minister, Anthony Albanese, meeting her Indonesian counterpart during the visit. She also visited Vietnam before arriving in Malaysia for Tuesday’s meeting with Saifuddin. “It is important that we listen to concerns, we respond to them respectfully,” Wong said in Kuala Lumpur. “That’s how the new government will seek to deal with some of the issues that have been raised and we hope that over time, people’s concerns will be able to be allayed.” Wong said Labor had taken the decision to support the Aukus pact while in opposition, and she said Australia had no nuclear ambitions. Labor extends term of Australian defence force chief Angus Campbell by two yearsRead more “We are not a nuclear power,” she said. “There are nuclear powers in this region but Australia is not one of them.” “What we are doing is replacing an existing capability with a new capability, and that is nuclear-propelled submarines. We remain very clear that we do not seek and nor would we ever seek to have any nuclear capability on our submarines.” In an implicit reference to China’s growing assertiveness, Wong said Australia understood the region was being “reshaped economically and strategically” and countries in the region, including Malaysia and others south-east Asia were attempting to “navigate this period of change”. She said Australia’s objective was not to meet aggression with aggression, but rather bolster the rules-based order. “Australia will always operate on the basis that we have this objective: a region that is peaceful, a region that is stable, a region that is prosperous, a region in which sovereignty is respected, and importantly, a region where rules enable some predictability to state behaviour and the way in which disputes are dealt with,” Wong said.

The defence secretary also called for increases in personnel numbers, despite recent cuts to the army, and warned of future shortfalls in naval and air force crews, as well as in long-range rocket artillery.  The leaked request, first reported by Talk TV, emerged on the eve of the Nato summit in Madrid, which will discuss the renewed threat posed by Russia and the anticipated commitment of hundreds more British troops to the defence of Estonia. A defence source said “We do not comment on alleged leaks”, but added that “the defence secretary and the prime minister have always said that the government will respond to any changes in threat, which is why in 2020 the Ministry of Defence received a record defence settlement”. The reports came as Gen Sir Patrick Sanders, the head of the army, also hinted that Britain would have to spend more on defence in response to Russian aggression. The chief of general staff said the British army had to mobilise “to prevent war”, arguing that the military faced a “1937 moment” in which it had become necessary to modernise and adapt “to meet today’s threat”. The service chief did not directly call for extra spending but told a land warfare conference that it was necessary for the UK and other European Nato members to assume more of the cost of defending Europe given the US’s growing concern with China. “Given the commitments of the US in Asia in the 20s and 30s, I believe the burden of conventional deterrence will fall increasingly to European members of Nato.” He also hinted at possible changes in the size of the army in response to the changed global situation, saying the land force needed to adapt its structures. “Of course, adapting structures has implications for the size of the army,” Sanders said. “Put simply the threat has changed and as the threat changes we will change with it”. Ministers announced a £16.5bn cumulative increase in UK defence spending for the four years from April 2021, but experts have already warned that rising inflation means that increases will be eroded in real terms during the rest of the parliament. Figures released by Nato on Monday also show that Britain is projected to spend 2.12% of national income on defence in 2022, above the alliance’s 2% target but below the 2.26% spent in 2021 and 2.3% in 2020. During the Nato summit, the UK is expected to confirm it will commit up to 1,000 more soldiers to help protect Estonia, on top of 1,700 stationed there. It is part of a wider Nato policy to increase the forces committed to defend frontline states in eastern Europe to the size of a brigade. Although Russia invaded Ukraine in February, and the UK has been at the forefront of giving weapons to Kyiv such as M270 rocket artillery and NLAW anti-tank bazookas, no increase in the defence budget was announced in Rishi Sunak’s spring statement or since. Wallace has been pushing for a budget increase for several months. The minister wrote to the chancellor on 11 March to warn that without further increases Britain risked falling below the 2% minimum level by 2025. There is a longstanding concern in the Treasury that the MoD frequently wastes money on costly procurements, and the public accounts committee said in November that it was unclear what extra capability the UK would get from the extra £16.5bn that had already been committed. Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am Labour said it would support plans to increase defence spending in response to Russia’s attack on Ukraine – and accused the Conservatives of presiding over ill-timed cuts to the military, including a commitment made in March last year to reduce the size of the British army by 9,500 by 2025. John Healey, the shadow defence secretary, said: “Labour has argued for months that ministers should reboot defence plans in response to Ukraine, but the government has kept saying Putin’s illegal invasion proved their defence plans for fewer troops, planes, and ships were right.” Britain expects to spend £32.4bn on day-to-day defence needs in the current year, 2022-23, plus a further £15.8bn on capital – meaning that any uplift to 2.5% would mean an increase of billions more.",,,,

Nato leaders have announced a new “strategic concept” in response to Russia’s war against Ukraine, describing Moscow as “the most significant and direct threat to allies’ security and stability”. Nato has invited Sweden and Finland to become members of the military alliance, according to a communique published by the Nato summit in Madrid. Leaders also pledged further help to Kyiv and agreed on a package of support aimed at modernising the country’s defence sector.

Russian president Vladimir Putin issued fresh warnings that Russia would respond in kind if Nato set up military infrastructure in Finland and Sweden after they joined the US-led alliance. If Sweden and Finland wanted to join Nato then they should “go ahead” Putin said. “But they must understand there was no threat before, while now, if military contingents and infrastructure are deployed there, we will have to respond in kind and create the same threats for the territories from which threats towards us are created.”

Putin also pushed back against allegations that Russian forces were responsible for a strike on a crowded shopping centre in the Ukrainian town of Kremenchuk on Monday in which 18 people were killed. “Our army does not attack any civilian infrastructure site. We have every capability of knowing what is situated where,” Putin said. Moscow said its military fired a “high-precision air attack at hangars where armament and munitions were stored” and the explosion of those weapon caches caused a fire in the nearby shopping centre– a claim discredited by first-hand accounts from survivors and expert analysis.

Ukraine announced the largest exchange of prisoners of war since Russia invaded, securing the release of 144 of its soldiers, including 95 who defended the Azovstal steelworks in Mariupol. Ukrainian military intelligence said that most of the Ukrainians released had serious injuries, including burns and amputations, and are now receiving medical care.

The frequency of shelling on the eastern Ukrainian city of Lysychansk is “enormous”, the regional governor of Luhansk said on Wednesday. Lysychansk “is constantly being shelled with large calibres. The fighting is continuing at the outskirts of the city. The Russian army is trying to attack constantly,” Serhiy Haidai said.

At least four people were killed and five wounded by a Russian missile strike on a residential building in Ukraine’s southern city of Mykolaiv, local officials said. Photographs from the scene showed smoke billowing from a four-storey building with its upper floor partly destroyed by the attack on Wednesday morning. Moscow admitted to the strike on the city but said its forces had hit what it called a training base for “foreign mercenaries” in the region.

Joe Biden announced that the US will increase its military forces across Europe with more land, sea and air deployments. During a Nato summit in Madrid, Biden announced the stationing of a brigade of 3,000 combat troops in Romania, two squadrons of F-35 fighters in the UK and two navy destroyers in Spain. Nato members are expected to announce further commitments to a strengthening of forces on the alliance’s eastern flank.

Britain will also commit an extra 1,000 troops and one of its two new aircraft carriers to the defence of Nato’s eastern flank. The forces will be earmarked for the defence of Estonia, where Britain already has about 1,700 personnel deployed, but they will be based in the UK, ready to fly out to defend the Baltic country if deemed necessary. 

Separately, Downing Street said it has pledged another £1bn ($1.2bn) in military aid, almost doubling the UK commitment to military support. Defence secretary, Ben Wallace, said some money would likely be spent on supplying longer-range rocket artillery. This will be a “first step” to allow Ukraine to move towards “mounting offensive operations” to regain territory,” Downing Street said.

Zelenskiy announced the end of diplomatic ties between Ukraine and Syria after the Russia-ally recognised the independence of eastern Ukraine’s two separatist republics, Donetsk and Luhansk. “There will no longer be relations between Ukraine and Syria,” Zelenskiy said, adding that the sanctions pressure against Syria “will be even greater.”

Ukraine and the European Union have signed an agreement that liberalises road transport. According to the agreement, Ukrainian carriers no longer need to obtain permits to enter the European Union.

Turkey says it will seek the extradition of 33 alleged Kurdish militants and coup plot suspects from Sweden and Finland under a deal to secure Ankara’s support for the Nordic countries’ Nato membership bids. Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdogan dropped weeks of resistance to Sweden and Finland joining Nato after crunch talks ahead of Wednesday’s Nato summit in Madrid. 4d ago00.28Russia’s state natural gas producer Gazprom will increase gas supplies to the Baltic exclave of Kaliningrad, regional governor Anton Alikhanov said on Wednesday, amid increased tensions with neighbouring Lithuania.Russian President Vladimir Putin in May told Gazprom it should consider boosting liquefied natural gas (LNG) supplies to Kaliningrad - a region sandwiched between Nato members Lithuania and Poland.Alikhanov said the decision to increase supplies was made at a meeting with Russian Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak.

They want to join Nato, go ahead.
But they must understand there was no threat before, while now, if military contingents and infrastructure are deployed there, we will have to respond in kind and create the same threats for the territories from which threats towards us are created.”Putin said it was inevitable that Moscow’s relations with Helsinki and Stockholm would sour over their Nato membership.Everything was fine between us, but now there might be some tensions, there certainly will.
It’s inevitable if there is a threat to us.” 4d ago23.02SummaryIt’s 1am in Kyiv. Here’s where things stand:

The mother of Alex Drueke, a U.S. military veteran who went missing after he traveled to help Ukraine in its fight against Russia has spoken with her son by telephone, the family said Wednesday. “He sounded tired and stressed, and he was clearly reciting some things he had been made to practice or read, but it was wonderful to hear his voice and know he’s alive and alright,” she said.
The frequency of shelling on the eastern Ukrainian city of Lysychansk is “enormous”, the regional governor of Lugansk said on Wednesday. Lysychansk “is constantly being shelled with large calibres.

Canada announced that would increase its diplomatic presence in central and eastern Europe as well as the Caucasus on Wednesday in attempts to “help counter Russia’s destabilizing activities” the region. “Canada is announcing that we are increasing our diplomatic footprint. Canada will be opening four new embassies in Estonia, Lithuania, Slovakia and Armenia,” Canadian foreign minister Melanie Joly said on the sidelines of a NATO summit in Madrid.
Turkey said Wednesday it would seek the extradition of 33 alleged Kurdish militants and coup plot suspects from Sweden and Finland under a deal to secure Ankara’s support for the Nordic countries’ NATO membership bids.

The breakaway states of Donetsk and Lugansk are situated in the Donbas region at the centre of Russia’s invasion and have escaped Kyiv’s control since 2014. Moscow recognized their independence in February. Earlier on Wednesday, Syria became the first state other than Russia to formally recognize the two separatist republics. “There will no longer be relations between Ukraine and Syria,” Zelensky said in a video posted on Telegram, adding that the sanctions pressure against Syria “will be even greater”.
Zelensky described Syria’s move as a “worthless story”.In 2018, Syria recognised South Ossetia and Abkhazia as independent from the former Soviet state of Georgia, prompting Tbilisi to cut diplomatic ties.Abkhazia and South Ossetia are internationally recognised as part of Georgia, which gained independence from the Soviet Union in 1991, but Russia and a handful of other countries recognise their independence. 4d ago22.02Mother of missing US military veteran in Ukraine speaks to son on phoneThe mother of a U.S. military veteran who went missing after he traveled to help Ukraine in its fight against Russia has spoken with her son by telephone, the family said Wednesday.Associated Press reports: Lois “Bunny” Drueke, of Tuscaloosa, answered a call from what appeared to be a Russian exchange and talked to son Alex Drueke on Tuesday for nearly 10 minutes in their first conversation since he and Andy Huynh, another Alabama veteran who traveled to Ukraine, were captured after a fight earlier this month in Ukraine.Apparently at the prompting of his captors, Drueke said the people holding him were anxious to begin negotiations and that he had food, water and bedding, Bunny Drueke said in a statement released by her family.“He sounded tired and stressed, and he was clearly reciting some things he had been made to practice or read, but it was wonderful to hear his voice and know he’s alive and alright,” she said.Drueke said he hadn’t been in contact with Huynh for several days, according to the woman. The United States has said both men should be protected as prisoners of war under the Geneva Conventions.Huyhn’s fiance, Joy Black, said his family was thrilled the Drueke was able to speak with his mother.“We are still hoping to get a similar communication from Andy,” she said.Druke and Huynh didn’t return to a meeting spot after their group came under heavy fire in the Kharkiv region of northeastern Ukraine near the Russian border on June 9. The two traveled separately to help Ukraine and became buddies there in part because of their shared Alabama background, relatives have said.The U.S. State Department said it was looking into reports that Russian or Russian-backed separatist forces in Ukraine had captured at least two American citizens. If confirmed, they would be the first Americans fighting for Ukraine known to have been captured since the war began Feb. 24.This undated photograph provided by Diane Williams shows U.S. military veteran Alexander Drueke of Tuscaloosa, Ala., and his mother, Lois “Bunny” Drueke.

The fighting is continuing at the outskirts of the city. The Russian army is trying to attack constantly,” governor Serhiy Haidai said. 
“Now there is a peak of fighting. The frequency of shelling is enormous,” he said, adding that out of the population of nearly 100,000 prior to the war, the city has only about 15,000 civilians remaining. Their evacuation “might be dangerous at the moment,” he said.The Russians “brought in big numbers of vehicles, enormous number of people. Shelling and attacks do not stop,” Gaiday said.Mosow, which is currently setting its sights on Lysychansk, has already taken over the neighboring city of Siervierodonetsk after several weeks of fighting which killed dozens of civilians. It is the last major city the Russians need to take over in the Lugansk region, one of two provinces in the large Donbas region that Moscow wants to control completely. 4d ago20.25Canada announced that would increase its diplomatic presence in central and eastern Europe as well as the Caucasus on Wednesday in attempts to “help counter Russia’s destabilizing activities” the region. “Canada is announcing that we are increasing our diplomatic footprint. Canada will be opening four new embassies in Estonia, Lithuania, Slovakia and Armenia,” Canadian foreign minister Melanie Joly said on the sidelines of a NATO summit in Madrid.The announcement came as G7 and NATO leaders including Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau meet this week on how to support Ukraine in its fight against the Russian invasion. “This diplomatic expansion will help guide Canada’s response to evolving security threats, enhance political and economic cooperation to support European allies, and further counter the impacts of the Russian invasion of Ukraine and support Armenia in its democratic development,” the ministry said in a statement.The ministry said the changes would also “further enhance Canada’s engagement in the region, help counter Russia’s destabilizing activities and increase support for Operation REASSURANCE.”That international military operation, under which 1,400 Canadian soldiers are deployed in Latvia, is currently Ottawa’s biggest. Its goal is to reinforce NATO’s collective defense.“We believe that diplomacy remains one of the most effective ways to support security and stability,” Joly said in Madrid.US Secretary of State Antony Blinken (L) speaks with Canadian Foreign Minister Melanie Joly during a round table meeting at a NATO summit in Madrid, on June 29, 2022.

The agreement eliminates the need for Ukrainian carriers to obtain permits to enter the EU. Previously, each country provided a specific number of quotas for freight transportation from Ukraine.— The Kyiv Independent (@KyivIndependent) June 29, 2022 4d ago18.59SummaryIt’s 9pm in Kyiv. Here’s where we stand:
Nato leaders have announced a new “strategic concept” in response to Russia’s war against Ukraine, describing Moscow as “the most significant and direct threat to allies’ security and stability”. Nato has invited Sweden and Finland to become members of the military alliance, according to a communique published by the Nato summit in Madrid. Leaders also pledged further help to Kyiv and agreed on a package of support aimed at modernising the country’s defence sector.

The US president, Joe Biden, has announced that the US will increase its military forces across Europe with more land, sea and air deployments. Arriving at a two-day Nato summit in Madrid, Biden announced the stationing of a brigade of 3,000 combat troops in Romania, two squadrons of F-35 fighters in the UK and two navy destroyers in Spain.

Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has told Nato leaders in Madrid that it is “absolutely necessary” for countries to support Kyiv “with weapons, finances and political sanctions against Russia”. In a virtual address, he warned Moscow’s ambitions did not stop at his country but that its war was for “the right to dictate conditions in Europe – for what the future world order will be like”.

Zelenskiy also accused the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, of becoming “a terrorist” leading a “terrorist state” and urged Russia’s expulsion from the United Nations. In a virtual address on Tuesday, Zelenskiy called for the UN to visit the site of Monday’s missile strike on a shopping mall in the city of Kremenchuk, which killed at least 18 people.

Zelenskiy has shared CCTV footage of the moment the Kremenchuk shopping mall was hit by a Russian missile strike on Monday, saying it was a deliberate attack. “It is clear that Russian killers received those exact coordinates for this missile [launch]. They wanted to kill as many people as possible in a peaceful city,” Volodymyr Zelenskiy said in a video address.

First-hand accounts from survivors and expert analysis have discredited Moscow’s account of the deadly missile strikes on a shopping mall in the Ukrainian city of Kremenchuk. A spokesperson for Russia’s defence ministry said its military fired a “high-precision air attack at hangars where armament and munitions were stored”, and the explosion of those weapon caches caused a fire in the nearby shopping centre, which he said was “non-functioning” at the time.

At least three people were killed and five wounded by a Russian missile strike on a residential building in Ukraine’s southern city of Mykolaiv, local officials said. Photographs from the scene showed smoke billowing from a four-storey building with its upper floor partly destroyed by the attack on Wednesday morning. Moscow admitted to the strike on the city but said its forces had hit what it called a training base for “foreign mercenaries” in the region.

Syria has said it officially recognised the independence and sovereignty of the Russian-controlled territories of Luhansk and Donetsk in eastern Ukraine. The Syrian presidency affirmed its intention to build relations with the two self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic and Luhansk People’s Republic. Until now, the only UN member state to recognise their legitimacy had been Russia.

Britain’s prime minister, Boris Johnson, said he would most likely attend this year’s G20 summit even if Vladimir Putin decides to go. Johnson said he would be “absolutely amazed” if the Russian leader attended the November event in Bali in person, but that to boycott the summit would simply “leave the whole argument” to Russia and its allies.

The UK has announced new sanctions against 13 individuals and entities, including the oligarch Vladimir Potanin, described by the British government as Russia’s second-richest man. Also among those newly sanctioned is Vladimir Putin’s cousin, Anna Tsivileva, who is president of the JSC Kolmar Group coal mining company.

Putin was quoted by Russian news agencies as saying he could not rule out that tensions would emerge in Moscow’s relations with Helsinki and Stockholm over their joining Nato.  “We don’t have problems with Sweden and Finland like we do with Ukraine,” the Russian president told a news conference in the Turkmenistan capital of Ashgabat. “We don’t have territorial differences.” “If Finland and Sweden wish to, they can join. That’s up to them. They can join whatever they want.” However, he warned “if military contingents and military infrastructure were deployed there, we would be obliged to respond symmetrically and raise the same threats for those territories where threats have arisen for us”. Russia has repeatedly warned Finland and Sweden against joining Nato, saying the “serious military and political consequences” of such a move would oblige it to “restore military balance” by strengthening its defences in the Baltic Sea region, including by deploying nuclear weapons. Russian officials earlier reacted angrily to Nato’s offer of membership to Finland and Sweden, calling it a “destabilising” effort that will increase tensions in the region. “We condemn the irresponsible course of the North Atlantic Alliance that is ruining the European architecture, or what’s left of it,” Russian deputy foreign minister Sergei Ryabkov told reporters on Wednesday. “I have a great deal of doubt as to whether the upcoming period will be calm for our north European neighbours,” he added. Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BST The decision followed Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, which has prompted Russian neighbours to appeal to Nato for additional security guarantees. Some have said that Russia will target countries in eastern and northern Europe that have condemned the war and joined international aid and sanctions efforts. A communique published at a Nato summit in Madrid said that the “accession of Finland and Sweden will make them (the allies) safer, Nato stronger and the Euro-Atlantic area more secure”. Map But in Russia, the news was met coolly. Konstantin Kosachev, a member of Russia’s Federation Council, said that the accession of Finland and Sweden into Nato would “certainly mean a worsening of relations between these two countries and Russia”. He noted that Finland and Russia share a long land border, while Russia and Sweden have shared interests in the Baltic and Barents Sea areas. ‘A historic change’: how Sweden and Finland trod separate paths to NatoRead more “All of this would definitely change for the worse, and definitely not at Russia’s initiative,” he said. “This can only be regretted.” The accession of the two countries into Nato would mean the end of a decades-long status quo that saw Finland, in particular, maintain a degree of neutrality during the cold war in order to avoid a direct confrontation with the Soviet Union. 04:05'A dangerous neighbour': why Finland and Sweden want to join Nato – video explainer In the week before the decision, Russia’s foreign ministry announced that it would cut ties with a Finnish NGO and banned two Swedish organisations, the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency and the Swedish Institute. In a statement, the ministry accused the organisations of “focusing on efforts to destabilise Russian society”. Tensions have risen between Russia and countries in the Baltic region, which are members of Nato, raising concerns of a direct clash between Moscow and members of the security alliance. ‘There will be no way back’: will war change Finland’s pragmatic approach to Russia?Read more Vladimir Dzhabarov, another senior lawmaker, told a Russian radio station on Wednesday that a blockade of Russia’s Kaliningrad region could lead to an “armed conflict” with Lithuania. “If we feel that this security is being violated and it threatens us with the loss of our territory, of course, we will take extreme measures and nothing will stop us,” he said. Russian officials have disregarded arguments that they are to blame for the Nato enlargement prompted by the invasion, as well as Nato’s decision to “deploy additional robust in-place combat-ready forces on our eastern flank”. “In the end, [Finland and Sweden] will delegate some of their foreign political and defence sovereignty to Washington and other so-called senior Nato partners,” said Ryabkov, calling it “cover” for the alliance’s “aggressive intentions” toward Russia. “A new strategic concept will be adopted, and Russia will be designated as a threat to the alliance. This has nothing to do with real life; it’s the alliance that poses a threat to us.”",,,,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4bd34be70826aee52d35069499ec3f9e554c1f51/0_187_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=04040decad425a613c024aba68232189

Speaking at a briefing call on Wednesday, Celeste Wallander, the assistant secretary for defence for international security affairs at the Pentagon, told reporters that strong Turkish defence capabilities would reinforce Nato’s defences.  Biden met Erdoğan at the Nato summit in Madrid the day after a last-minute agreement between Turkey, Finland and Sweden was sealed, in which the two Nordic countries vow to take steps to control support for Kurdish terrorism in their countries. Erdoğan had been threatening to block Sweden and Finland from joining Nato indefinitely in a move designed to assert Turkey’s centrality to Nato, and press the rest of the alliance to take the threat of Kurdish terrorism on its southern borders more seriously. Turkey lifts objections to Finland and Sweden’s Nato bidRead more Biden rewarded Erdoğan’s lifting of the veto by staging the Madrid meeting and authorising his officials to say they were willing to help in the modernisation of the Turkish air force. The US president also thanked Erdoğan for his role in trying to broker an UN-endorsed agreement in which stockpiles of Ukrainian grain could leave the Black Sea ports. Russia notified the UN it was willing to go along with the plans overseen by Turkey in which 25m tonnes of grain would be shipped out of the Ukrainian-held and heavily mined port of Odesa in safe convoys. Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BST Discussing the modernisation of the Turkish air force, Wallander said: “The United States supports Turkey’s modernisation of its fighter fleet because that is a contribution to Nato security and therefore American security … These plans are in the works. And they need to be worked through our contracting processes.” Turkey made a request to the US in October to buy 40 Lockheed Martin-made F-16 fighters and nearly 80 modernisation kits for its existing warplanes. Washington had not previously openly expressed an opinion on the sale aside from saying all weapons sales would have to go through the necessary legal processes. US officials rejected any suggestion Washington was backing the warplane request in order to remove Turkey’s objections to Sweden and Finland’s entry to Nato. Washington said Congress would have a final say on the deal. The sale of the fighter jets is contentious because Turkey bought a Russian air defence system that many US senators say is incompatible with Nato membership. Map Turkey also moved to exploit the deal to demand the immediate extradition from Sweden of a named group of Kurds and supporters of the cleric Fethullah Gülen. In the deal signed with Turkey in Madrid on Tuesday, Finnish and Swedish leaders promised not to support the Kurdish PKK or the Syrian YPG groups, or any supporters of Gülen, whom Turkey blames for a failed coup attempt in 2016. Turkey’s justice minister, Bekir Bozdağ, said on Wednesday he was awaiting the extradition of 33 terrorism suspects from Sweden and Finland, adding that Ankara will remind the Nordic countries of the extradition after the signing of a memorandum. Minna Ålander, of the German Institute for International and Security Affairs, questioned the practical impact and novelty of the commitments made by Sweden and Norway. She said: “It has been very carefully worded by diplomats so both sides can read into it what they want.” She said from a Swedish perspective, nothing substantive had been conceded even if the wording was designed to allow Turkey to say otherwise. “That is the beauty of the agreement,” she said. Ålander said the deal does not, for instance, require Sweden to change its domestic law on extradition or its approach to specific extradition requests that are handled by an independent judiciary. Ann Linde, the Swedish foreign minister, said: “We will not agree to any extraditions unless there is proof of terrorist activity. There is no reason for Kurds to think that their human rights or democratic rights are at risk.” The agreement includes provision for a joint implementation committee to monitor the deal, but the memorandum remains a political agreement and not a legally binding international treaty.

Arriving at the meeting in Madrid, the US president announced the stationing of a brigade of 3,000 combat troops in Romania, two squadrons of F-35 fighters in the UK and two navy destroyers in Spain.  “The US and its allies are going to step up. We’re stepping up. We’re proving that Nato is more needed now than it ever has been,” Biden said in a short statement he read out before the first summit meeting began. Nato needs permanent force in eastern Europe to deter Russia, says EstoniaRead more Biden’s announcement is expected to be followed by further commitments by Nato members to a strengthening of forces on the alliance’s eastern flank, which was being discussed by Nato leaders on Wednesday morning. The morning meeting heard an address from Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, in which he called on Nato members to supply more advanced weaponry, particularly artillery, to help “Ukraine end this war by winning on the battlefield now”. He also warned that Kyiv needed financial support to deal with the costs of fighting Russia. “We need about $5bn a month,” Zelenskiy said, arguing that his country was fighting a country identified as Nato’s most serious threat. “We are deterring Russia from destroying us and from destroying you,” he said. Britain confirmed that it would increase its commitment to a Nato battlegroup in Estonia from 1,700 by about 1,000, although the extra forces will be based in the UK, earmarked to deploy to the country at short notice if needed. In total, eight frontline Nato battlegroups stretching from Estonia to Bulgaria, once designed to act as small initial defence force, are expected to be increased in size to a brigade level of 3,000 to 5,000 troops. Different Nato members will contribute to each as part of radical change in the alliance’s military posture. Germany has already said it will increase its existing commitment to Lithuania to the size of a brigade. 01:32Zelenskiy releases footage of 'deliberate' Russian strike on shopping mall – video The US president also said the US fifth army corps would establish a permanent base in Poland, extra troops would be committed to the Baltic states and extra air defence systems would be stationed in Germany and Italy. It was, Biden said, a response to Russian aggression, adding: “Together with our allies, we are going make sure Nato is ready to meet threats across every domain, land, air and in the sea”, which came “at a moment when Putin has shattered peace in Europe and the very tenets of rules-based order”. The US sent a further 20,000 troops to Europe earlier this year, taking the total based across the continent to over 100,000. Wednesday’s announcements come on top of that and Biden said the US would “continue to our adjust our posture” if necessary. Nato’s new defence plans mean that 300,000 troops would be placed at high readiness to deter any Russian attack. The forces will be available at a few days or weeks’ notice to be sent into the frontline if necessary. Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BST Later, Biden also thanked his Turkish counterpart, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, for reaching a deal with Finland and Sweden to allow the Nordic countries to end decades of neutrality and join Nato, at a bilateral meeting between the leaders. US officials added that they now supported Turkey’s desire to buy F-16 fighter jets and upgrade its air force. “The US Department of Defense fully supports Turkey’s modernisation plans,” Celeste Wallander, assistant secretary of defence for international security affairs, said. The leaders attending the summit signed off on a new Nato strategic concept, the first time the alliance has revised its vision statement since 2010. It formally recognised that Russia poses “the most significant and direct threat to allies’ security”. The 2010 summit where the old document was agreed was attended by Russia’s then president, Dmitri Medvedev, Stoltenberg recalled. “We agreed that Russia is a strategic partner for Nato and we had meetings with Russia at the Nato summit. And of course, this will not be the case now.” The new document also referred to China for the first time, warning that Beijing’s “stated ambitions and coercive policies challenge our interests, security and values” and that a “deepening strategic partnership” with Russia, and the two countries’ attempts to undercut the rules-based international order, “run counter to our values and interests”.",,,,

The forces will be earmarked for the defence of Estonia, where Britain already has about 1,700 personnel deployed, but they will be based in the UK, ready to fly out to defend the Baltic country if deemed necessary.  Speaking at the Nato summit in Madrid, Ben Wallace said the UK would “allocate a brigade” to Estonia, effectively an increase in the number of British troops available to about 3,000, saying it would be more efficient to base some of the forces at home and their equipment in Germany. The commitment forms part of Nato’s revamped European defence force, which will comprise 300,000 troops across the continent placed at high readiness in case Russia threatens a military attack on any member of the alliance. A substantial part of Britain’s commitment to the defence force announced at this week’s Madrid summit would be naval, Wallace added: “We will put in a huge amount of the Navy. I think we’ll dedicate one of the carrier groups to it.” Britain operates two aircraft carriers, the Queen Elizabeth and the Prince of Wales, which have a supporting fleet of ships, known as a carrier strike group. The warships would be committed to Nato on rotation, said Wallace. Separately, Downing Street has said it is almost doubling the UK commitment to military support for Ukraine with an additional £1bn. While No 10 gave no details about what the money might be used for, Wallace said some would be likely to be spent on supplying the longer-range rocket artillery sought after by Ukraine in conjunction with the US and other Nato countries. Previously, the UK had sent three M270 weapons systems, as part of a package of 10 promised by the US and Germany. The UK would also send electronic warfare equipment, air defence systems and more ammunition, Wallace added. Eight Nato defence forces are based in eight countries on the eastern side of the alliance, from Estonia to Bulgaria, and on Wednesday Nato members agreed to increase them to the size of a brigade in response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Germany has already agreed to increase its commitment to Lithuania, but faced criticism when it emerged that most of the extra 3,500 troops it was offering would be based on its own soil, ready to move east quickly if needed. But Wallace defended the decision, and argued that a surprise attack by Russia on the Baltic country was unlikely. “You are not going to get a massive surprise,” he said, noting that Russia placed more than 100,000 troops on the borders of Ukraine for several months before it invaded in February. Existing plans to defend Estonia and the other Baltic countries were outdated, Wallace said, because the existing plan was to allow “60 days to get the tanks there”. But he added that Russia’s attack on Ukraine had changed everybody’s thinking: “Quite rightly, the Baltic states were saying, ‘Well, what we just witnessed in Ukraine was that if you wait five days, there’s no one left alive. So we don’t want to take the risk and wait until our car ferry gets across with the tanks.’” Wallace also tried to play down differences over defence spending with No 10, while indicating that he wants budgets to rise at the end of the current spending review period in April 2025. Governments had taken “a peace dividend” after the end of the cold war, but it was time now for “investment to continue”. The minister said he agreed with Boris Johnson that the existing target of spending 2% of GDP on defence was “set in a different era” and that “Russia wasn’t the same as it is now”. But he declined to say whether, as suggested by leaks earlier in the week, the budget should increase by about £10bn to 2.5%. Asked in a TV interview at the summit if he was at odds with Wallace over the defence budget, Johnson dodged the question, saying only that spending had “increased massively” in recent years.",,,,

The Commons privileges committee has announced that No 10 staff will be able to give evidence anonymously to its inquiry into whether Boris Johnson lied to MPs about Partygate. (See 2.54pm.) In a statement, the committee said it was particularly interesting in hearing from people with knowledge of “Mr Johnson’s knowledge of the activities in 10 Downing Street and the Cabinet Office under Covid regulations, from the occurrence of those events until now” and “any briefing given to, or inquiries made by, Mr Johnson relating to those events”.

Dominic Raab has expressed doubts about including the right to an abortion in the forthcoming bill of rights, saying the matter was already “settled in UK law”.

China would be making “a catastrophic miscalculation” if it invaded Taiwan, Liz Truss has said, telling the Nato summit that the UK and other countries should reconsider trading relationships with countries that used economic power in “coercive” ways.

Ben Wallace, the UK defence secretary, has publicly called for higher defence spending by the middle of the decade in light of Russia’s war on Ukraine, in a move that sets him at odds with Boris Johnson and Rishi Sunak.

Tariffs on steel imports from China and other countries are to be extended for another two years, the UK government has announced, admitting the move risks breaching World Trade Organization (WTO) rules.

John Swinney, Scotland’s deputy first minister, has issued a correction after sowing confusion over the Scottish government’s claims it could win a mandate for independence at the next general election. 4d ago16.59Johnson claims he came up with idea for European political community-type organisation before MacronBoris Johnson has claimed that the concept of a new European political community - floated recently by the French president, Emmanuel Macron - is an idea first thought up by him, the BBC’s Jessica Parker reports.NEW: Boris Johnson says the idea of a European political community was in fact his, not Emmanuel Macron’s“Emmanuel has an idea which I actually claim paternity of,"" he told reporters on a flight to the NATO summit ""I had this idea back when I first became Foreign Secretary.”— Jessica Parker (@MarkerJParker) June 29, 2022
But PM's idea perhaps stretches a little further. He said, ""My view is that we should rebuild the whole concept... so I think Turkey should be there. I think with Maghreb should be there. And I think that you should basically be recreating the Mare Nostrum of the Roman Empire.""— Jessica Parker (@MarkerJParker) June 29, 2022
""There's got to be a role for all of us in that in a wider conversation about issues that affect all of us,"" Boris Johnson said.( Yday, Foreign Secretary Liz Truss clearly rejected the idea of a new political community - pointing to NATO & the G7 as ""key"" alliances. )— Jessica Parker (@MarkerJParker) June 29, 2022
But PM Johnson seems to feel a little more warmly about it - although he concedes there are perhaps, ""several different ideas"" in the mix. ""That doesn't mean that they're necessarily the same.

When details of her leaving party emerged in the media she released a statement admitting it took place and saying she was “truly sorry”.She has been on discretionary paid leave from her £190,000-a-year Sheffield job ever since.The cross-party Sheffield council committee considering her actions has now concluded its work, it said.Josephs has been given a written warning but can return to her job as chief executive.
The decision was made based on the facts at hand and with very careful consideration. The committee acknowledges that Kate has apologised and believes that she feels genuine remorse.Terry Fox, the Labour leader of Sheffield council, said: It’s no secret that I’ve been deeply disappointed by Kate Josephs’ actions. Over the last few months I’ve repeatedly said that I share the anger and upset felt by some Sheffielders about the choices Kate has made. Those feelings don’t just go away overnight.
But I am here to deliver for Sheffield, and that is what matters the most to me now. The chief executive’s work to rebuild trust across the city and organisation begins now. Kate and I will also need to rebuild our relationship, and I do believe we are both committed to doing that. We must, and we will, keep driving our amazing city forward. The people of Sheffield deserve that – they are my priority today and always.The Gray report outlined how Josephs’ leaving do was attended by 20 to 30 people, with six pizzas ordered for those still in the room more than two hours later. Josephs left in the early hours after tidying up, the report said.Josephs posted a further apology on Twitter, saying: “I have made mistakes for which I am deeply sorry. I intend to learn from these mistakes and continue to work hard to be the very best chief executive I can be for our city.”I have made mistakes for which I am deeply sorry.

She cited the government’s legal advice on the bill, which says “the doctrine of necessity provides a clear basis in international law to justify the non-performance of international obligations under certain exceptional and limited conditions”.Giving evidence to the Northern Ireland affairs committee, Prof Alan Boyle, emeritus professor of public international law at the University of Edinburgh, said he was “aghast” at the way Truss defended the bill. He explained:She was defending this on the basis of the international law principle of necessity. Well, I hope somebody has a word with her and tells her not to say that, because necessity as an international law is a defence to a breach of international law. So it’s only relevant if you’re already breaking international law.
So the foreign secretary is virtually saying: ‘Oh, yes, we’re breaking international law but it’s alright, because it’s necessary.’ Well, that’s utter nonsense.
You know, can you imagine counsel for the UK in the arbitration? They’re going to be faced with the other side saying: ‘Oh the foreign secretary has admitted there’s a breach of international law,’ so she really is shooting herself in the foot.Boyle said what the government was trying to do, in terms of ignoring parts of the protocol, would be “defensible”, but only if the government did this using article 16 - a provision in the protocol allowing one side to unilaterally disapply parts of the treaty in certain situations.The government considered triggering article 16, but decided to table the Northern Ireland protocol bill as an alternative.Updated at 16.07 BST 4d ago15.44The Good Law Project, a campaigning group, has launched judicial review proceedings against the Metropolitan police over their investigation into Partygate.

Effectively he seemed to blame it all on Sadiq Khan, the Labour mayor of London. He told MPs:Over the last three years, this government has overseen the largest funding boost for policing in a decade and we are well on the way to recruiting an extra 20,000 police officers nationally, with 2,599 already recruited by the Metropolitan police, giving them the highest-ever number of officers.
By contrast, as many Londoners will attest, the mayor has been asleep at the wheel and is letting the city down.
Teenage homicides in London were the highest they have ever been in the last year and 23% of all knife crime takes place in London, despite it having only 15% of the UK population.
The mayor must acknowledge that he has profound questions to answer. He cannot be passive and continue as he has. He must get a grip.In response Sarah Jones, the shadow policing minister, said that Malthouse’s statement was “incredibly weak” and that it was for the Home Office to lead on changes to the Met.Kit Malthouse.

He said: Yes, he’s been formally invited. I don’t think he will go. The question is: do we as the Western countries vacate our seats at the G20 and leave the whole argument to China, to Russia?
Much of the conversation at the G7 has been about, are we doing enough to win over the swing voters? What can we do with the middle of the congregation, the people who look at Ukraine and have mixed feelings? We need to be doing more to win them over. We need to be making our case.
I think if you vacate something like the G20 you risk just handing the propaganda opportunity to others.",/p/ymca8,6573.0,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2022/jun/29/ben-wallace-boris-johnson-nato-defence-conservatives-angela-rayner-dominic-raab-pmqs-uk-politics-latest-live#comments,

Nato has formally invited Sweden and Finland to become members of the military alliance, according to a communique published by the Nato summit in Madrid. Nato secretary general Jens Stoltenberg has said he expected a swift ratification of their membership, telling reporters “After invitation, we need a ratification process in 30 parliaments. That always takes some time but I expect also that to go rather quickly because allies are ready to try to make that ratification process happen as quickly as possible.”  Joe Biden has announced that the US will increase its military forces across Europe with extra land, sea and air deployments. The US president announced the stationing of a brigade of 3,000 combat troops in Romania, two squadrons of F-35 fighters in the UK and two navy destroyers in Spain. “The US and its allies are going to step up. We’re stepping up. We’re proving that Nato is more needed now than it ever has been,” Biden said in a short statement he read out before the first summit meeting began. Nato allies will continue to supply Ukraine with weapons in its war against Russia for as long as necessary, German chancellor Olaf Scholz said in Madrid. British prime minister Boris Johnson urged Nato allies to boost their defence spending in response to Russia’s invasion “to restore deterrence and ensure defence in the decade ahead”, his office said. Ukraine’s foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba praised Nato for its “clear-eyed stance” on Russia and for inviting Finland and Sweden to join the military alliance. Kuleba tweeted that Nato leaders had taken “difficult, but essential decisions” at the summit in Madrid. The summit was addressed on video by Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskiy. At least three people were killed and five wounded by a Russian missile strike on a residential building in Ukraine’s southern city of Mykolaiv on Wednesday, said local authorities who have launched a rescue effort for survivors. Mayor Oleksandr Senkevych said eight missiles had hit the city, and urged residents to evacuate. He said the building appeared to have been hit by a Russian X-55 cruise missile. Russia has claimed to have destroyed a training base for foreign mercenaries near Mykolaiv in its latest military operational briefing. Fighting continues in all settlements of the Lysychansk community, according to Serhai Haidai, Ukraine’s governor of Luhansk. “The shelling continues constantly, the destruction is catastrophic” he said. Ukraine’s president accused Russian leader Vladimir Putin on Tuesday of becoming “a terrorist” leading a “terrorist state” and urged Russia’s expulsion from the United Nations. In a virtual address to the UN security council, Zelenskiy urged the UN to establish an international tribunal to investigate “the actions of Russian occupiers on Ukrainian soil” and to hold the country accountable. Ukraine’s president called for the United Nations to visit the site of a missile strike on a shopping mall in the city of Kremenchuk. “I suggest the United Nations send either a special representative, or the secretary-general of the United Nations … so the UN could independently find out information and see that this indeed was a Russian missile strike,” he said of Monday’s attack which killed at least 18 people. The Russian army claimed Tuesday it had hit a nearby weapons depot with the explosion sparking the blaze at the shopping centre, which according to Moscow was “not operational” at the time. Kirill Stremousov, deputy head of the Russian-backed administration in occupied Kherson, has said a date for a referendum for the region to join the Russian Federation had not yet been chosen, but that he expected the vote in “the coming half year”. Russia-installed officials in Ukraine’s Kherson region said their security forces had detained Kherson city mayor Ihor Kolykhayev on Tuesday after he refused to follow Moscow’s orders, while a Kherson local official said the mayor was abducted. Syria has said it officially recognised the independence and sovereignty of the two breakaway regions of Luhansk and Donetsk in eastern Ukraine. It becomes only the second UN member state to do so, after Russia. In an interview with the NBC network in the US, Zelenskiy has compared scenes he saw at Bucha to a war movie, saying “It was just so quiet, everything was destroyed, dead people, destroyed army equipment. There was this sense of death. When they found people in the bottom of wells, hands bound, raped, and murdered – they’d done everything to them. I just didn’t know that this could be done by people who, 30 years previously, we had lived together in the Soviet Union, in one country. I just never had thought that humanity could be capable of this, and this changes how you look at people.” Indonesia’s president, Joko Widodo, arrived in Kyiv to meet Zelenskiy. The Indonesian president is the current chair of the G20 group, and his European trip is also expected to include a visit to Moscow and meet Russian President Vladimir Putin. Vladimir Potanin, known as the “Nickel King” and Russia’s second richest person, has become the latest Russian oligarch to be subjected to sanctions by the UK as ministers target “Putin’s inner circle”. The government announced sanctions against Potanin, who was deputy prime minister under Boris Yelstin; Anna Tsivileva, a cousin of Putin and president of the prominent Russian coal mining company JSC Kolmar Group; and Said Gutseriev, son of the already blacklisted Russian billionaire Mikhail Gutseriev. Russia has not ruled out seizing western assets held on its territory. Foreign ministry press secretary Maria Zakharova said Russia was prepared to “act accordingly” if the west decided to use Russia’s frozen state assets – chief among them being around $300bn of central bank foreign currency reserves. She said the use of such funds “will be interpreted by us as an unlawful and defiantly unfriendly attack, giving us the right to take retaliatory actions to protect our interests. We should not forget about the foreign assets of western countries, businesses and citizens who are located on the territory of our country.”",,,,

In a sign of how far UK government attitudes towards China have shifted since the self-declared “golden decade” under David Cameron, the British foreign secretary said trade should be directed at countries that could be trusted.  Speaking at the Madrid summit, Truss said that with China expanding its strategic ambitions, Nato’s new strategic concept should reference China specifically. The alliance’s core mission was last updated in 2010 and is due to be revised. Truss’s comments came a day after she called for more rapid action to help Taiwan with defensive weapons in case China invaded, saying that was a key lesson from the Russian invasion of Ukraine. “I do think that with China extending its influence through economic coercion and building a capable military, there is a real risk that they draw the wrong idea that results in a catastrophic miscalculation such as invading Taiwan,” Truss said, speaking alongside Anthony Albanese, the Australian prime minister, and Alexander De Croo, the Belgian prime minister. One of the areas addressed by the G7 summit in southern Germany, which ended earlier this week, was efforts to offer more western infrastructure money for developing nations, a response to China’s “belt and road” programme that seeks to bring influence through similar investment. Given the threat from both China and Russia, there was a “need to reach outward and create that network of liberty of fellow like-minded countries”, Truss said. The G7 countries and nations such as Australia should use their “economic weight” to challenge China, she said, adding that countries such as the UK could even rethink their approach to trade with Beijing. “I think historically we haven’t used that economic power,” she said. “We’ve been equidistant, if you like, about who we trade with, who we work with. And I think countries are becoming much more focused now on, is this trade with trust, do we trust this partner? Are they going to use it to undermine us, or are they going to use it for the mutual benefit of both of our economies? So trade has got a lot more geopolitical.” Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BST Speaking on Tuesday before the Commons foreign affairs committee, Truss went notably beyond the standard government language on Taiwan by saying there was a need to provide the island with defensive weapons. “We should have done things earlier. We should have been supplying the defensive weapons into Ukraine earlier,” she said. “We need to learn that lesson for Taiwan. Every piece of equipment we have sent takes months of training, so the sooner we do it, the better.”",,,,

Updated at 09.17 BST 4d ago09.04Penny Wong says Australia is considering imposing sanctions on MyanmarAt a media appearance in Kuala Lumpur earlier today as part of her visit to Malaysia, the foreign minister, Penny Wong, signalled that the Australian government is actively considering imposing sanctions on Myanmar.More than one year on from the military coup that overthrew Aung San Suu Kyi’s government, the junta continues to detain Australian Sean Turnell despite pleas for his release.Asked if there was any move to impose sanctions against Myanmar, and whether she had sought advice on any military figures who would be best to target, Wong said:I said clearly before the election that was something we thought was necessary, and you should anticipate that that’s a matter under active consideration. 
But what I would say on Myanmar is this: obviously, Myanmar has been a topic in the meetings I’ve been having in the region. I have been struck by the extent to which members of Asean with whom I have met are realistic about, and share our frustration about, the lack of progress in relation to the five-point consensus. 
It’s important for us to engage with regional leaders about the next steps we wish to take as well as others seek to take in Myanmar.Wong later said:Prof Turnell is our first priority when it comes to Myanmar and we have obviously engaged with regional counterparts about this issue.Wong also noted she engaged with the National Unity Government of Myanmar – a government in exile formed by politicians ousted by the coup – while in opposition and said: “I can flag to you that it is my intention to do so again.”Updated at 09.09 BST 4d ago08.44Daniel HurstOwnership of Darwin port Australia’s decision as sovereign nation, US Marines commanding officer saysThe US respects Australia’s right to make its own sovereign decisions about the ownership of the Port of Darwin, according to the commanding officer of the US Marines in Darwin.With Anthony Albanese flagging a fresh review of a Chinese company’s long-term lease over the port, US Marines Corp Col Christopher Steele said he had not encountered any practical hindrances from the ownership arrangements.Steele, who is commanding officer of the 2022 Marine Rotational Force-Darwin Rotation, told reporters in Canberra this afternoon:I’m certainly aware of the ownership of the port. The perspective that we have is that Australia is an ally, Australia is a sovereign nation and it has made the decision ... I have not had a problem not being able to do something in Australia. I think my only problem is I want to do too much.The Northern Territory’s then Country Liberal party government granted a 99-year lease over the Port of Darwin to Landbridge Group in 2015.The previous Morrison government last year ordered a review of any national security implications surrounding the Port of Darwin, but this did not lead to any action. Albanese, who was previously critical of the sale, said during a visit to Darwin earlier this month that “we’ll have a review of the circumstances of the port”. The prime minister added that this work would be done “in an orderly way”.Speaking to reporters at the US embassy today, Steele said there were currently about 1,800 Marines in Darwin as part of the latest rotational force, but the numbers fluctuated because the US also brought in a “surge force” for specific named exercises. At the same press event, US Marines Corp Capt Joseph Di Pietro voiced support for increased trilateral exercises with Japan and Australia:These are two of our most important allies. They are very closely related and we absolutely cherish any opportunity to train with them from a tactical level.

Lead author Dr Luke Dawson, a cardiologist at Alfred Health and Monash University, said the study included 213,544 people with chest pain transported by ambulance to emergency departments over that time period.“The median offload time increased from 21 minutes in 2015 to 24 minutes during the first half of 2019,” Dawson said.“... The risks of death and ambulance re-attendance with chest pain within 30 days of initial ED presentation were higher when the offload time exceeded 17 minutes, and that longer offload times were associated with presentations by people over 65 or women, at hospitals with larger total bed numbers, and presentation between 8 am and midnight, on weekdays, or during winter or spring,” Dawson and colleagues wrote in the paper.Read more here: Emergency overload: how Covid exposed Australia’s straining hospital systemRead moreUpdated at 07.35 BST 4d ago07.09Albanese and Johnson meet at Nato summitWe just saw live images of prime minister Anthony Albanese meeting with his British counterpart Boris Johnson on the sidelines of the Nato summit in Madrid.

Brown told the inquiry that West was “extremely upset” when she was told of the decision on 1 October last year. A few days later, on 4 October, Barilaro announced he was resigning from parliament and the new minister, deputy Liberal party leader Stuart Ayres, decided not to go ahead with making the roles ministerial appointments.When asked during the inquiry why she didn’t reoffer the job to West, Brown said that the situation had become “quite irreconcilable” because West was “very unhappy”.Brown said:The relationship declined quite quickly once she was informed that she may not be going to New York so by the end of the first process I’d formed the view there was no suitable candidate.”Updated at 07.37 BST 4d ago06.44Regulators to scrutinise impact of social media algorithmsJosh TaylorThe Australian regulators responsible for overseeing Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and other social media networks say they will be focusing in the next year on the impact of algorithms, and what the platforms are doing to protect consumer data and reduce harm.The Australian Communications and Media Authority (Acma), the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC), the eSafety commissioner, and the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner (OAIC) met on Tuesday to determine their focus for the next financial year.

Photograph: Nam Y Huh/APBurke accused the previous Morrison government of saying regulating the gig economy was “too complicated”, and said the agreement struck by Uber and the TWU “shows that’s not the case at all” and that the Coalition “just couldn’t be bothered to act”. Burke said:We don’t want Australia to be the sort of country that allows workers to earn less than the minimum wage or be subjected to dangerous, unregulated conditions.
Australians want the flexibility and the convenience of the gig economy but they don’t want the people on the other end of the app getting ripped off or dying on our roads.
Without proper regulation, even if a platform tries to do the right thing by their workers – as Uber has today – the risk is they will be undercut by a rival that turns up on the market.
That’s why the government will extend the powers of the Fair Work Commission to be able to set minimum pay and standards for gig workers. It is the appropriate independent body to do this job. This will deliver a national approach that gives the commission the scope and flexibility it needs to deal with “employee-like” forms of work”.You can read more about the landmark agreement here:Uber and Transport Workers’ Union strike agreement on gig economy employment standardsRead moreUpdated at 06.10 BST",,,,

Our North America edition splashes on the US supreme court decision to reverse women’s abortion rights. Having been leaked in May, the news was not entirely unexpected but nonetheless sent shock waves around America and the world. With many now fearing what a court dominated by religious conservatives will do next, David Smith examines the political fallout and how, if at all, it could be countered. Then on the Opinion pages, Sonia Sodha argues that liberals’ faith in the courts to preserve abortion rights was misguided from the start.  For readers elsewhere, we return to the war in Ukraine. In Europe, leaders from the European Council, G7 and Nato were meeting this week, at a critical juncture for the conflict. Amid fears that Russia is gaining the upper hand on several fronts, it seems clear that the west needs a strategic rethink over how to tighten economic and military pressure on Vladimir Putin, without leading to a backlash among western consumers and starvation in the global south as a result of grain blockades. Diplomatic editor Patrick Wintour sets the scene at a pivotal moment. Energy correspondent Alex Lawson asks what will happen if Russia shuts off gas supplies to Europe this winter, and Lorenzo Tondo reports from Kyiv, where the spectre of war has returned for the first time in weeks. Look out for a couple of great longer reads this week. First, Louisa Lim’s search for the King of Kowloon, an enigmatic street prophet and graffiti artist who died a few years ago, but whose work is mysteriously reappearing around Hong Kong. Then, there’s a brilliantly thought-provoking piece on how to explain racism to children – and raise an antiracist – from Ibram X Kendi, an American author who has taught millions of people to think differently.

Recep Tayyip Erdoğan said at the close of the alliance’s summit in Madrid that the 10-article agreement with the Nordic pair was a victory for Ankara and addressed all its “sensitivities”.  He particularly stressed the satisfying of Turkey’s demand for Sweden and Finland to extradite terror suspects with links to outlawed Kurdish groups or the network of an exiled cleric accused of a failed 2016 coup in Turkey. But Erdoğan added that if the two Nordic countries renege on their promises, Turkey’s parliament could refuse to ratify the deal reached on Tuesday. Nato accession must be formally approved by all 30 member states, which gives each a blocking right. 04:05'A dangerous neighbour': why Finland and Sweden want to join Nato – video explainer “This business will not work if we don’t pass this in our parliament,” Erdoğan said. “First, Sweden and Finland must fulfil their duties and those are already in the text … But if they don’t fulfil these, then of course there is no way we would send it to our parliament.” Erdoğan claimed that Sweden had promised to extradite 73 “terrorists” to Turkey and crack down on the financing and recruitment activities of the Kurdistan Workers’ party (PKK) –– listed as a terrorist group by the US and the EU –– and linked groups. Turkey considers the Syrian Kurdish People’s Protection Units (YPG) an extension of the PKK. The text of the memorandum sets no specific number of extraditions. It says Finland and Sweden will address Turkey’s “pending deportation or extradition requests of terror suspects expeditiously and thoroughly, taking into account information, evidence and intelligence provided” by Turkey in accordance with the European convention on extradition. Erdoğan gains from lifting Sweden and Finland Nato veto with US fighter jet promiseRead more On Wednesday, the Turkish justice minister, Bekir Bozdağ, said Sweden and Finland’s justice ministries have files from Turkey on 33 people with alleged links to PKK and the network of US-based Turkish cleric Fethullah Gülen. Journalists repeatedly pressed Erdoğan on Thursday about the extraditions and whether Sweden had actually promised the number he cited. He said the number of extradition requests previously stood at 60 but had been updated to 73. “Of course, what we understand is important from our meetings and talks,” Erdogan said. “Sweden promised to give us these 73 people with this text. They may or they may not, we will follow that through the text and we will make our decision.” There was no immediate response to requests for comments from the Swedish delegation at the summit in Madrid. The Swedish government has sought to allay concerns that the deal would lead to extraditions to Turkey without due process. “I know there are some people who are worried that we’re going to start to hunt people and extradite them, and I think it’s important to say that we always follow Swedish laws and international conventions, and we never extradite Swedish citizens,” the Swedish prime minister, Magdalena Andersson, told public broadcaster SVT on Wednesday. The Finnish president, Sauli Niinistö, stressed Helsinki pointed out that the memorandum does not list the names of individuals. “In the case of extraditions, we will adhere to our own legislation and international agreements. Ultimately, extradition is a legal discretion which politicians have no right to influence,” Niinistö said.

It is a process that involves national parliaments –– and could take months.

After Johnson’s announcement, a source close to the defence secretary said Wallace had “always been clear that as the threat changes, so should defence spending”. Defence sources said the decision would mean a total budget of £74.5bn in 2029-30, and a cumulative extra £55.1bn to reach 2.5% in 2030. With many Conservative backbench MPs pressing for the government to slash taxes, the announcement raises questions about where Johnson’s priorities lie – and what offer the Tories will make at the next election on tax and spending. Liz Truss defends plans to cut British army by nearly 10,000 troops Read more Torsten Bell, the director of the Resolution Foundation, said: “If we’re permanently going to get to 2.5%, then you are talking about a significant shift in what the state is doing. In the long run, we’ve managed to grow our welfare state without raising taxes, by shrinking the military. If we’re wanting to reverse the direction of travel on that, then you’re not also going to be able to turn around the NHS and have taxes substantively coming down.” Johnson is planning to make a joint speech with the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, in the coming weeks, setting out how the pair see the UK economy, against a backdrop of soaring inflation. At a press conference capping a nine-day trip during which the prime minister has also attended a Commonwealth summit in Rwanda and the G7 summit in southern Germany, Johnson said Vladimir Putin had succeeded in uniting the west against Russia. He said there had been “strong unanimity” at Nato and the G7 but the argument on supporting Ukraine had to be made across the international community. He said he had been listening to “other voices, some of whom I think are under a misapprehension about what is really going on, and who is really to blame, and the spikes in fuel prices, under a misapprehension about what Nato really is”. With soaring food and fuel prices back home, Johnson was asked whether there was a risk that consumers would suffer from Ukraine “fatigue” as the cost of living crisis bites. He replied that the “point about the cost of freedom is that it is always worth paying”. Labour said the prime minister should shoulder some of the responsibility for falling living standards, however. The shadow financial secretary to the Treasury, James Murray, said: “We must of course do all we can to support Ukraine as Russia’s aggression continues. “But the Tories have only got themselves to blame for a decade of stagnating wages, low growth, higher taxes and poor delivery. They have let the country down and are looking for any excuse instead of fixing the problems they created. Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BST At the press conference, Johnson said Nato should offer a security guarantee for Ukraine: “All of Nato, or just some Nato countries, should be offering deterrence by denial, so that we fortify Ukraine with Nato-grade weaponry, plus intelligence, plus training, so that no future attack is conceivable. “That’s stage one, and that’s the position we want to get to. And I think that will prove to be a very effective solution. There can then be a further argument down the track about Nato, but that would be my interim solution.” Earlier, Downing Street had announced it would almost double the UK commitment to military support for Ukraine with an additional £1bn. The announcement prompted a backlash from the Welsh government, however, after it emerged that £95m would come from the devolved Scottish and Welsh budgets. The Welsh finance minister, Rebecca Evans, said the move was “worrying and potentially divisive”.",,,,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/67abd52a0d593e25ba2c1ec27e7f1b2e47337e5e/0_116_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=c3873ea1e21e89d72aa01ed22dff329b

After this week’s Nato summit in Madrid, that charge is harder to sustain. Nato provided the structure for emergency western efforts to support Ukraine following Russia’s unprovoked invasion in February. Four months on, the alliance has now put that on a more long-term footing, with major financial, strategic and regional consequences. Yet important uncertainties still remain. Nato’s repurposing has four elements. The first is strategic – recognising that attempts to form a cooperative relationship with Russia have ended for the foreseeable future, and that Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, inexcusable in itself, also marks a wider confrontation with the west. The second is the reversal of the post-1989 era of declining defence budgets. This has now been replaced by an expanded deterrence marked by aid to Ukraine, higher military spending for the coming decade and a sevenfold increase in the number of Nato troops on high alert to reach 300,000.  The third element is a partial U-turn on European deployments by the US. America’s pivot to the Pacific, confronting the rise of China, has not been abandoned, but President Biden is now authorising the largest scaling up of the US military presence in Europe since the cold war. Significantly, most of this American scaling up will be in the east of our continent, with a new headquarters in Poland, 5,000 additional troops in Romania and more intense deployments in the Baltic states. Finally, Nato has expanded its membership, formally inviting Sweden and Finland – the latter has an 800-mile land border with Russia – to join the alliance. This ends more than 70 years of neutrality by the two Nordic nations. It is a sign of how decisively the Ukraine invasion has destroyed wider trust towards Russia. But it has huge military implications in the Baltic. It was only achieved after Turkey, a more than usually crucial Nato member during the current conflict, lifted its earlier veto, perhaps amid promises that the US would soon supply it with enhanced F-16 fighters jets. These are major changes. Russian aggression has pushed the west across a big policy watershed. However, in some ways this is also a return to a once familiar security landscape. It finds Nato, in effect, embarking on a new cold war mission. It marks, potentially, the birth of a new era of collective western deterrence of Russian power. The implications for domestic and international politics should not be underestimated. But the world – and the Europe – of the 2020s is very different from that of the late 1940s. Whether the new Nato strategy will unfold in a similar manner to the cold war, perhaps for the same length of time and with the same ultimate success, is unknowable. Much depends on what happens on the battlefield in the coming months. The democracies will all face big dilemmas about spending priorities and military commitments. A change of administration in Washington could transform the outlook radically, leaving Europe struggling to maintain sufficient support, and tempting Russia to simply sit the confrontation out. It is important not to exaggerate, especially prematurely. Yet this is a permanent problem for Britain. Words and pledges are not the same as plans, outputs, deployments, training and spending. Much of what was agreed in Madrid will take years to come into effect, if at all. Boris Johnson and some ministers who are manoeuvring to replace him are showboaters whose inflated language is aimed solely at the Tory party. Threats against China, of the kind that Liz Truss made this week, are an example.

Photograph: Denis Doyle/Getty Images","The US president, Joe Biden, in Madrid","Thursday, 30 June 2022",2022-06-30,What did the G7 and Nato summits really mean for Ukraine?,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jun/30/what-did-the-g7-and-nato-summits-really-mean-for-ukraine,"Over five days, the leaders of the G7 and Nato shifted from the pastoral backdrop of the Bavarian Alps to the more prosaic plains of Madrid, but at no point was there a shortage of photo opportunities, trumpeting of democracy, multibillion-dollar announcements or pledges of unstinting resolve to help Ukraine. But as the leaders head home to their more mundane domestic challenges, it is legitimate to ask how far these promises change the balance of power on the battlefield, or put doubt in the mind of Vladimir Putin. For although these summits were an exercise in reassurance to domestic electorates, and to a lesser extent to Ukraine, the target audience was really one man: the Russian president.  Not surprisingly, he gave off the impression of insouciance. In central Asia, on his first trip overseas since the war began, he claimed: “The work is going quietly, rhythmically, the troops are moving and are reaching the lines that have been given to them as milestones. Everything is going according to plan.” The sudden, and somewhat mysterious, withdrawal of the Russian garrison from Snake Island (measuring 600 metres by 700 metres) might suggest otherwise, but it is not the start of the removal of all Russian troops from Ukraine, including Crimea, a war objective restated as realistic by the UK foreign secretary, Liz Truss, on Thursday. Part of the difficulty is that these summits were not quite the council of war that Volodymyr Zelenskiy needed, partly because Joe Biden did not want to play into Russian propaganda by portraying Nato as anything other than a defensive alliance, the armoured guardian of its own territory. The Nato summit was largely about the consequences of Russia’s invasion, not for Ukraine but for countries already inside or about to join Nato. It was about “defending every inch of Nato territory”, as Biden put it. 01:24Boris Johnson pledges to increase defence spending to 2.5% of GDP – video Ukraine does not directly benefit from the admission into Nato of the “two paladins of peace”, as Boris Johnson described Sweden and Finland. The same applies to the sevenfold increase in Nato forces on high alert, the establishment of the first permanent US operational headquarters on the alliance’s eastern flank in Poland, the increase in the number of US troops in the region, or a new 10-year strategy that dispenses of any notion of partnership with Russia. That is not to minimise their significance. On paper, the intention to build such high-readiness forces is the greatest systemic – and mental – change in Nato planning since the end of the cold war, but it has no impact on the killing fields of Donbas. To paraphrase Zelenskiy, he does not need a new Nato strategic concept – he needs ammunition. But that does not mean no progress was made. For one thing, the French president, Emmanuel Macron, could not have been more blunt in his criticism of Putin, or clearer that avenues to a ceasefire are closed. If there is a premature peace faction, it does not reside in Paris. For Zelenskiy himself, the summit was about finances, weapons and politics. On finance, Ukraine is gobbling up an extraordinary $5bn a month as its economy and exports degrade, but the US is prepared to underwrite this. Biden promised another $800m in defence assistance in the next few days, including a new advanced air defence system. The UK, the second biggest supplier of military aid, agreed to spend another €1.15bn of military aid to Ukraine. Germany, going round in circles about delivering arms, has been better at subsidising Ukraine’s economy. A further “recovery summit”, dedicated to the reconstruction of Ukraine, will be held in Lugano on 4-5 July, which Zelenskiy himself is slated to attend. On weapons, before the summit, Mikhail Podolyak, an adviser to the Ukrainian president, gave an inventory of Ukraine’s needs: 1,000 155mm-calibre howitzers, 300 multiple-launch rocket systems, 500 tanks, 2,000 armoured vehicles, and 1,000 drones. Ukrainian forces, officials say, have lost 700 armoured vehicles in the last three months, and replacements are urgently needed. Both France and Spain have responded with the offer of tanks or armoured personnel carriers. Above all, they need ammunition or artillery. Russian artillery is firing 40,000-60,000 missiles a day, while Ukrainian artillery can respond with 5,000 to 6,000. Worse, the west does not have the ammunition for the old Soviet artillery systems that Ukraine uses. So far, the US has only delivered four Himars launchers, but more deliveries from both the US and the UK have been promised. At present they are being used almost exclusively to hit Russian ammunition depots in the Luhansk region. There can be no counter-offensive planned for the summer or the deployment of newly trained forces on the frontlines unless there is a transformation in the speed and volume with which weapons are supplied. Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BST There is also an urgency. Putin believes time is on his side and that Russia “can pound the longest”. Just as the Ukrainian forces can only suffer a certain level of attrition, so too western politicians can only risk the wrath of their electorates for so long. The proposals from the US to cut the price of Russian oil, and from Italy to curb the price of Russian piped gas – discussed at length at the G7 – were probably the two most significant ideas to emerge from the summits. Macron admitted these ideas are currently a construction site. They urgently need a lot more work if the west is to find a way to hit the Russian economy, and protect European consumers. US state department officials were in London as soon as the summit ended to pursue ideas with the Treasury. Gustav Gressel, a security analyst at the European Council on Foreign Relations, identifies a “western policy preference to fight this war as an economic contest as opposed to a military one”. But, he argues, looking at things developing on the ground, the other way round would be better: “The Russian economy could be stabilised by Moscow, arguably at a lower point, but still. Economics is not Putin’s playground, and he will not have his geopolitical ambition tamed by economic setbacks. On the other hand, breaking Russia’s offensive capabilities by providing Kyiv with the tools to do so (tanks, infantry fighting vehicles, artillery, air defence) would be the cheaper solution.” The next few months, not these summits, will prove whether those tools will be provided.",,,,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/512a4817458e7cdb9bccc1f704b3e3ddef1d9112/0_107_4675_2806/master/4675.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=7ac8e3bafdff233e99a19ee0a3e9c3fc

The US president also announced another $800m (£660m) of military aid to Kyiv – but questions remained about how much detail there was behind the plan to create a 300,000-strong force to deter any Russian attack.  Speaking at a final press conference in Madrid on Thursday, Biden was pressed twice as to whether there would be any limit to US military aid and financial support for the regime in Kyiv as the war rages for a fifth month. “We’re gonna stick with Ukraine, and all of the allies will stick with Ukraine, as long as it takes, and in fact make sure they are not defeated,” Biden told a press conference on Thursday lunchtime. But the president did not predict that Ukraine would be able to kick the Russians out, even with a continued supply of western weapons. “I don’t know how it’s going to end, but it will not end with a Russian defeat of Ukraine,” he said. The president repeated the formulation when asked how long it would be fair for global consumers to pay for higher petrol prices because fighting was continuing. People would have to wait “as long as it takes; Russia cannot in fact defeat Ukraine”. Biden said the US would unveil the fresh package of military aid in the next few days comprising “new advanced weapon and air defence systems, more artillery ammunition, counter-battery radar, additional ammunition for Himars [rocket artillery] and a couple of large rocket systems”. US military aid to Ukraine had already exceeded $7bn, Biden added, making Washington easily the largest donor of advanced weapons systems of the type that Kyiv says it desperately needs to blunt a gradual but remorseless Russian advance in the eastern Donbas region. Ukraine pushes Russian forces from strategic Snake IslandRead more During the summit, the UK said it would make available a further £1bn of lethal aid, for electronic warfare, air defence and ammunition, taking its total to £2.3bn. France said it would send six more Caesar cannons of the type that Russian bloggers said had pressured Moscow’s forces to abandon Snake Island in the Black Sea on Thursday. The president’s address concluded one of Nato’s most significant meetings, the alliance having been revitalised and transformed by Russia’s unprovoked invasion of Ukraine in February. Earlier this week, a deal was reached with Turkey to allow Finland and Sweden to join Nato, the two Nordic countries abandoning decades of military neutrality, and strengthening the alliance’s position in the Baltic region. Biden said Putin wanted “the Finlandisation of Nato, but he got the Natoisation of Finland” and that Nato would now be “closer than ever” given that Finland shares an 830-mile frontier with Russia, far longer than any border of an existing member of the 30-country military alliance. Erdoğan warns Turkey could still block Finland and Sweden’s accession to NatoRead more After Biden spoken, Turkey’s president warned that Ankara could still block the process if the two countries fail to fully meet his expectations. At an impromptu press conference, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan claimed that Sweden had promised to extradite 73 “terrorists” to Turkey, a condition which was not included in the deal signed on Tuesday. Moscow’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, said a new “iron curtain” was descending between Russia and the west, in a meeting with his counterpart from Belarus, one of the few countries to maintain close links. “They should just be careful not to pinch anything,” he quipped. During the summit, Nato leaders signed off on creating a new 300,000 high-readiness force to deter any Russian invasion, and fresh information emerged about the plans on Thursday. Nato leaders in the conference hall in Madrid. Photograph: Anadolu Agency/Getty Images Nato sources said it would comprise 100,000 tier 1 troops available to move to the frontline in “zero to 10 days” and another 200,000 in tier 2 forces deployable for “up to 30 days”. Nevertheless, while the US and the UK announced fresh commitments during the summit, Nato officials acknowledged that the full plan would take until “mid-2023” to be concluded. A key point of tension remains among member states as to whether troops would be deployed in frontline countries or not. Insiders said that Estonia and Lithuania were among the frontline countries calling for thousands more Nato forces to be based in their territories. But for now the UK and Germany – for Estonia and Lithuania respectively – have only agreed to commit extra troops if they are based at home. “The plans are not complete because the processes of national negotiations are ongoing,” one senior military insider said. “Lithuania is saying, that’s great what you have offered, but we would like to have more. The Estonians say that’s great what UK is offered, but we may want to have a division.” Britain this week offered to commit 1,000 more troops to defending Estonia, adding to its existing force in the country of about 1,700 and taking the total of earmarked troops to the size of a brigade – but the defence secretary, Ben Wallace, said these would be based in the UK. Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BST A division would represent a far larger commitment, three to four brigades and perhaps 15,000. Britain has traditionally led Nato defence forces in Estonia, while Germany has taken responsibility for Lithuania. Earlier this month, Estonia’s prime minister, Kaja Kallas, said she feared her country could be “wiped off the map” under Nato’s existing and soon to be replaced defence plans. They allowed for the Baltic states to be overrun for 180 days before seeking to liberate them. Moscow on Thursday said that it had summoned the British ambassador to Moscow to protest against “offensive” British statements, including about alleged Russian threats to use nuclear weapons. The Russian foreign ministry said it had protested to Ambassador Deborah Bronnert over “the frankly boorish statements of the British leadership regarding Russia, its leader and official representatives of the authorities, as well as the Russian people”. It was not immediately clear what specific remarks the statement was referring to.",,,,

What better way to deal with two humiliating byelection defeats and a growing disaffection within the Tory party about his leadership than for Boris Johnson to spend a week abroad? A chance to forget. To let some of the heat die down. And to try to look worthwhile on a global stage. First at the Commonwealth heads of government meeting in Kigali. Then the G7 in Bavaria. And finally the Nato summit in Madrid. But all good things come to an end and the Convict wound up his travels with a final press conference before flying home. It looked as if the week had taken its toll. The hair and the suit were a mess, the skin blotchy and the bags under his eyes appeared to have deepened and darkened visibly in just seven days.  No matter. The Rwanda Panda would always look on his time abroad with fondness. At least he had been in the presence of world leaders who made the effort of treating him with a veneer of respect and sincerity. Not like back home. There even his own cabinet ministers refused to back up his idea that the privileges committee was a lawless kangaroo court whose findings could be disregarded. Still, best to be careful what you wish for. He could have found himself before a judge-led public inquiry. Johnson began by giving a recap of what the Nato summit had achieved. Beginning by praising the value of a unified supranational organisation. Even historically neutral countries, such as Sweden and Finland, now wanted to join. Some of the Nato countries present might have wished that he had taken the EU so seriously. Not to mention most of the UK. A new survey has found that more and more people are struggling to think of any positive impacts of Brexit. We’ve reached the point where the EU negotiator, Maroš Šefčovič, is actively trolling us by begging us to put everyone out of their misery and “get Brexit done”. The microphones then cut out for a few minutes, which was no great loss as the Convict used the time to reannounce several of the announcements he had made the day before. The UK and Nato stood alongside Ukraine and would be giving a further £1bn in military aid. Though hopefully not the eye-wateringly expensive Ajax armoured vehicles that the British army had found totally unusable and that had yet to enter service. On the other hand, what better way to kill two birds with one stone? Just offload the junk on to Ukraine. But that was not all. The Convict wound up his opening remarks by insisting that the UK would increase its defence spending to 2.5% of GDP by the end of the decade. How he intended to find the extra £10bn to pay for the increase he didn’t say. Largely because he didn’t have to. And because he didn’t care. There was next to no chance of him still being prime minister in eight years so he could afford to make as many promises as he liked. Just take the credit for an eye-catching, crowd-pleasing policy and let some other mug pick up the tab. We then moved on to the questions. Did he agree with Liz Truss that the only acceptable outcome of the Ukraine war was that Russia gave up all the land it had seized by force? The Rwanda Panda smiled. It was at times like this that he remembered why he had given Truss the job. What prime minister didn’t sometimes need a halfwit as foreign secretary? Someone to make him look good. Hell, she could barely complete a sentence on global geopolitics without sounding like an F-grade GCSE student. It wouldn’t surprise him if she couldn’t even locate Ukraine on a map. “It’s not for us to be more Ukrainian than the Ukrainians,” Johnson said. Surprising both himself and his audience by coming up with an intelligent answer. It wasn’t for Nato to tell Zelenskiy the terms on which he should negotiate a peace. That was down to him. Nato’s role was to make sure that Ukraine had the wherewithal to respond to Russian aggression as it saw fit. The Convict struggled more when the questions turned to domestic matters. Why didn’t the Conservatives have any plans for dealing with inflation? How come the UK was predicted to have the second-lowest growth – behind Russia – in the G20 countries? And why was the government pushing up the tax burden when so many people were struggling? “Er …” he said. There were some special factors at work. So special that he couldn’t actually remember what they were. But the government did have a plan. At least it would do when he and Rishi Sunak had come up with one. All we needed to do was get through the next three years without starving. Or becoming homeless. Things then became distressingly graphic. In the one statement that Vladimir Putin had made that the whole world could get behind, the Russian president had said Johnson would not be a pretty sight if allowed to pose with his shirt off. The Rwanda Panda looked slightly wounded and declined to offer an opinion. Though you could tell he thought – in a decent light – that he was still a catch. Still, better topless than bottomless.

They said “During the night, as a result of a successful military operation with our missile and artillery units on Snake Island, the enemy hastily evacuated the remnants of the garrison in two speedboats and probably left the island. Currently, Zmiinyi is covered with fire, explosions are heard. The final results of the operation are being investigated.” The Russian ministry of defence confirmed it had withdrawn, claiming it is a “step of goodwill” to facilitate grain shipments and calling on Kyiv to demine Ukraine’s waters. Russia claimed “This decision will not allow Kyiv to speculate on the topic of the impending food crisis, referring to the impossibility of exporting grain due to Russia’s total control of the northwestern part of the Black Sea. Now the word is up to the Ukrainian side, which has not yet cleared the Black Sea coast near its shores, including the port waters.”  The frontline eastern city of Lysychansk is under relentless shelling as Russia presses on with its offensive in eastern Ukraine. Ukrainian authorities said they were trying to evacuate residents from the city, the focus of Russia’s attacks where about 15,000 people remained. Regional Governor Serhiy Haidai told Ukrainian television: “Fighting is going on all the time. The Russians are constantly on the offensive. There is no let-up. Absolutely everything is being shelled.” One person has been killed and six people have been injured, including an 11-year-old, by Russian attacks in the Kharkiv region according to the latest status update of Oleh Synyehubov, governor of Kharkiv. The European court of human rights (ECHR) said it had issued an order to Russia to ensure that two Britons captured after fighting for Ukrainian forces do not face the death penalty. It is likely to have limited effect. This month, the Russian parliament passed legislation to end the jurisdiction of Europe’s top human rights court in Russia, and two weeks ago a Kremlin spokesperson, in reference to another ECHR ruling, said Moscow no longer implemented its decisions. The Kremlin said the fate of two Britons was a matter for authorities in the self-proclaimed republic in Donetsk in eastern Ukraine. Nato leaders yesterday announced a new “strategic concept” in response to Russia’s war against Ukraine, describing Moscow as “the most significant and direct threat to allies’ security and stability”. Leaders also pledged further help to Kyiv and agreed on a package of support aimed at modernising the country’s defence sector. Sweden and Finland are expected to formally sign the Nato accession protocol on Tuesday, secretary general Jens Stoltenberg said. The accession protocol must then be ratified by all 30 allied parliaments to allow both countries to become part of Nato and benefit from the alliance’s collective defence clause. Russian president Vladimir Putin earlier issued fresh warnings that Russia would respond in kind if Nato set up military infrastructure in Finland and Sweden after they joined Nato. He said it was inevitable that Moscow’s relations with Helsinki and Stockholm would sour over Nato membership. Putin said Moscow is “open” to a dialogue on “strategic stability, preserving non-proliferation regimes for weapons of mass destruction and improving the situation in the field of arms control”. The Russian president said efforts would require “painstaking joint work” and would go towards preventing a repeat of “what is happening today in the Donbas” in remarks to a legal forum in his home city of St Petersburg. Putin also pushed back against allegations that Russian forces were responsible for a strike on a crowded shopping centre in the Ukrainian town of Kremenchuk on Monday in which 18 people were killed. “Our army does not attack any civilian infrastructure site. We have every capability of knowing what is situated where,” Putin said. Moscow said its military fired a “high-precision air attack at hangars where armament and munitions were stored” and the explosion of those weapon caches caused a fire in the nearby shopping centre – a claim discredited by first-hand accounts from survivors and expert analysis. Russia’s former president and current deputy security council chairman, Dmitry Medvedev, said sanctions against Moscow may be seen as an act of aggression and justification for war. He said “I would like to point out once again that under certain circumstances such hostile measures can also qualify as an act of international aggression. And even as a casus belli” Sweden will send more anti-tank weapons and machine guns to Ukraine, Sweden’s defence ministry said Thursday. The arms package, which also includes equipment for mine clearing, is valued at around £40m ($49m). Spain will gradually raise defence spending to near the equivalent to 2% of the country’s gross domestic product by 2029, the prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, has said. US president Joe Biden has said that he is in favour of supplying new F-16 fighters to Turkey, but needs congressional approval. Meanwhile, Greece has sent an official request to the US for the purchase of 20 Lockheed Martin-made F-35 fighter jets. The UK’s foreign secretary, Liz Truss, has said it is a “realistic” ambition to push Russian forces out of Ukraine entirely. Truss has described Russian president Vladimir Putin as “an appalling dictator perpetrating a war that was neither legal nor justified” and said that “he has ordered the most appalling crimes to be committed in Ukraine.” Norway’s foreign minister has said her nation is not blocking Russian access to Svalbard. On Wednesday Russia accused Norway of disrupting the delivery of critical supplies and threatened retaliation. Anniken Huitfeldt said: “Norway is not breaking the Svalbard Treaty. The shipment that was stopped at the Norwegian-Russian border has been stopped on the basis of the sanctions that prohibit Russian road transport companies from transporting goods on Norwegian territory”. She said Russia could deliver supplies in a different way, exclusively by ship or by air. Trade through Lithuania to the Russian exclave of Kaliningrad could return to normal within days as officials edge towards a compromise deal, two sources familiar with the matter told Reuters. British government complacency is allowing Russian “dirty money” to flow into the UK despite the war in Ukraine, MPs have warned. The Commons Foreign Affairs Committee said the failure of ministers to take effective action meant assets “laundered” through the City of London were being used to finance Putin’s war. Indonesian president, Joko Widodo, has spoken of his visit to Kyiv to meet with Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, describing the visit as a “manifestation of the Indonesian people’s concern for the situation in Ukraine.” Ukraine announced the largest exchange of prisoners of war since Russia invaded, securing the release of 144 of its soldiers, including 95 who defended the Azovstal steelworks in Mariupol. Ukrainian military intelligence said that most of the Ukrainians released had serious injuries, including burns and amputations, and are now receiving medical care.
Zelenskiy announced the end of diplomatic ties between Ukraine and Syria after the Russia-ally recognised the independence of eastern Ukraine’s two separatist republics, Donetsk and Luhansk. “There will no longer be relations between Ukraine and Syria,” Zelenskiy said, adding that the sanctions pressure against Syria “will be even greater.” Formula One has sought to distance itself from remarks made by its former chief executive Bernie Ecclestone, who said he would “take a bullet” for Putin, whom he described as “a first-class person”.",,,,

About 300,000 troops across the continent will be placed at high readiness from next year in case Russia threatens a military attack on any member of the alliance, and Finland and Sweden will be formally invited to join.  Extra forces to be allocated specific allies to defend Existing Nato defences on the alliance’s eastern flank will be increased to the size of a brigade – about 3,000 to 5,000 troops in addition to local forces. Britain will commit an extra 1,000 UK-based troops and one of its two new aircraft carriers to the defence of Estonia, where Britain already has about 1,700 personnel deployed. Joe Biden, the US president, announced the stationing of a brigade of 3,000 combat troops in Romania, two squadrons of F-35 fighters in the UK and two navy destroyers in Spain. Heavy equipment positioned near borders with Russia Jens Stoltenberg, the Nato secretary general, explained that the new strategy meant heavy equipment would be positioned near Nato borders, with the ability to rapidly move people into place to use it. Before the summit, Estonia’s prime minister, Kaja Kallas, had claimed that existing Nato defence plans would give Russia the time to wipe Tallinn off the map before western troops could be mobilised. During the summit, the UK defence secretary, Ben Wallace, admitted it would have taken 60 days to move extra tanks to the Baltic states in the event of a conflict under the old plans. Russia identified as main threat to Nato A 2022 Nato strategic concept document was published, which identified Russia’s invasion of Ukraine as the driving force behind the changes. It was the first time the document had been revised since 2010, when Russia still attended Nato summits. It states: “The Russian Federation’s war of aggression against Ukraine has shattered peace and gravely altered our security environment. Its brutal and unlawful invasion, repeated violations of international humanitarian law and heinous attacks and atrocities have caused unspeakable suffering and destruction.” Finland and Sweden formally invited to join A deal agreed between Finland, Sweden and Turkey cleared the way for the formal invitation of the two Nordic states into the alliance. That signalled the end of the two countries’ traditional neutrality, which dated back to the cold war – and in Sweden’s case before that. Turkey’s objections were dropped after reaching a deal in which the two Nordic countries vowed to take steps to control support for Kurdish terrorism.

As photos of the Nato dinner at Spain’s royal palace filtered out, many were swift to spot what one Spanish news site described as the image of the summit: the Hungarian prime minister, Viktor Orbán, seated next to Gauthier Destenay, the first same-sex spouse of a leader of an EU member state.  Amid speculation as to whether the seating arrangement was intentional – perhaps a nod to this month’s Pride celebrations – or whether it was simply the mysterious hand of protocol working its magic, Spain’s royal palace did not respond to a request for comment.

He urged Orbán at the time to consider the potential harm the law could have on young people. “I didn’t get up one morning after having seen an advert on the TV of some brand … That’s not how life works. It’s in me, I didn’t choose it. And to accept oneself is hard enough, so to be stigmatised too, that’s too much.” The couple have, at times unwittingly, ended up in the headlines when Destenay has taken time off from his architectural practice to accompany his husband on state visits and summits.

Nato allies agreed for the first time to include challenges and threats posed by China into a strategy blueprint in its latest summit in Madrid this week. The alliance’s previous document, issued in 2010, made no mention of China.  In its new Strategic Concept, Nato said tackling “systemic challenges posed by the People’s Republic of China to Euro-Atlantic security” and the “deepening strategic partnership” between China and Russia would now be among its main priorities. Beijing was furious about Nato’s decision. “Who’s challenging global security and undermining world peace? Are there any wars or conflicts over the years where Nato is not involved?” China’s mission to the EU said in a statement on Thursday. “Nato’s so-called Strategic Concept, filled with cold war thinking and ideological bias, is maliciously attacking and smearing China. We firmly oppose it,” the statement said. “When it comes to acts that undermine China’s interests, we will make firm and strong responses.” Since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, China has been pointing its finger at the US and Nato on multiple occasions. But Nato’s attention to the China-Russia partnership began even before Moscow’s military operations in its neighbour. It has also been openly talking about China for some time. In its annual summit in Brussels last June, the traditionally Russia-focused military alliance asserted, for the first time, that it needed to respond to Beijing’s growing power. The language the bloc used at the time also echoed the EU’s phrase of “systemic rival”, and the UK’s “systemic competitor” when describing China. Expect China to be furious at being cast as a threat to the westRead more Beijing’s response was equally strong. When responding to Nato secretary general Jens Stoltenberg’s remark on China-Russia military ties last year around the time of the Brussels summit, a foreign ministry spokesperson urged the alliance to “abandon cold war mentality and ideological bias” – a similar language to the one deployed this week. This week, Nato was keen to add a layer of nuance into its descriptions of Russia and China. “China is not our adversary, but we must be clear-eyed about the serious challenges it represents,” Stoltenberg said on Wednesday, adding that Nato was still “open to constructive engagement” with Beijing. The language contrasted Nato’s view on Vladimir Putin’s Russia. “The Russian Federation is the most significant and direct threat to allies’ security and to peace and stability in the Euro-Atlantic area,” Nato’s Strategic Concept wrote, vowing to “continue to respond to Russian threats and hostile actions in a united and responsible way”. Yet, the alliance was clearly wary of Beijing’s close ties with Moscow. “The deepening strategic partnership between the People’s Republic of China and the Russian Federation and their mutually reinforcing attempts to undercut the rules-based international order run counter to our values and interests,” the blueprint said. It is not immediately clear what the talk of China in its latest strategy means for Nato operationally. “We know there will be greater collaboration with the EU on areas of China policy that the EU has more experience in, such as resilience and economic coercion,” said Meia Nouwens of the London-based thinktank International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS). She added: “The concept mentioned that the Alliance will work with existing and new partners in the Indo-Pacific. But we don’t know which new partners Nato is looking at – perhaps certain countries in south-east Asia or India.” Some experts have urged Nato to establish a “China council” to coordinate Nato’s policies on China, but there was no talk of it this week in Madrid. And in the last few days, reports emerged that France and Germany had objected to describing China as a “threat”, as it might jeopardise Europe’s interests in trade and technology. “It’s interesting that after three years of conversations about China and agreeing on the challenges that it poses to the alliance, allies still don’t fully agree on how to frame that discussion and how to respond,” said Nouwens.",,,,

International officials and journalists were bemused to find the salad – a combination of potatoes, mayonnaise and vegetables known as ensaladilla Rusa – being sold as “potatoes salad Russian style” at the summit venue.  “Russian salad at a Nato summit? I’m a little surprised by that choice of dish,” the journalist Iñaki López told the Spanish media outlet la Sexta. Russian salad on a menu at the Nato summit media centre restaurant. Photograph: Sabine Siebold/Reuters While the name did little to dampen its popularity – the dish reportedly sold out in hours – within a day it had been renamed, with the menu now listing it as “traditional salad”. The Spanish chef José Andrés went one step further, adding tomato dumplings and calling the dish Ukrainian salad in a show of solidarity at the dinner he coordinated for visiting defence and foreign ministers on Tuesday. It was an extension of a rebrand that began last month when Andrés announced he would change the dish’s name at all his restaurants, joining a wave of bars and restaurants to have done so in recent months. And starting tomorrow officially I’m announcing that the iconic Spanish tapa: Ensaladilla Rusa…..will change its name to Ensaladilla Kiev or Ensaladilla Ucraniana….at all my restaurants!!! https://t.co/NSb8HKcUaY— José Andrés (@chefjoseandres) May 14, 2022 Among the first was Mesón Martín, a three-decade old restaurant in the northern city of Zaragoza. “Friends, we’ve decided to change the name of the famous salad,” the restaurant announced on social media in late February. “From today, you will find the Kyiv salad on our menu, in solidarity with the people of Ukraine.” It is not the first time the Spanish staple – credited by many to the Italian-British cook Charles Elmé Francatelli – has fallen prey to politics. During the dictatorship of Francisco Franco, bars and restaurants often changed the name to ensaladilla nacional, or national salad, to avoid being associated with the distribution of pro-Communist propaganda. It is also not the first time food has ended up as a diplomatic pawn. In 2003 french fries and french toast were renamed “freedom fries” and “freedom toast” in US Congress cafeterias by Republicans outraged at France’s opposition to the invasion of Iraq.

Speaking as western leaders gathered in Madrid to discuss the alliance’s most significant transformation for a generation, the UK foreign secretary suggested there was no end in sight to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.  Truss pushed back against any “false peace” or “territorial compromise” being reached with the Kremlin, took swipes at several of her cabinet colleagues and called for Taiwan to be supported more in the face of threats from China. Splits have broken out over the government’s response to the Ukraine invasion during Boris Johnson’s international tour, with the defence secretary, Ben Wallace, pushing for the department to get a significant funding increase and the head of the British army calling a plan to reduce the army from 82,000 to 72,500 perverse. Truss defended the cut in troop numbers, telling BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “We all need to recognise that warfare now is different to warfare as it was 100 years ago, or 200 years ago.” Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BST She said: “We need to make sure that the defence capability we have is fit for purpose for the modern world – and we face all kinds of new threats, whether it’s cyber threats, threats in space, new technology, new weaponry, and what’s important is the overall shape of those forces.” Truss added there had been an extra £24bn for the UK’s defence budget and called on other Nato countries to meet the commitment to the 2% of gross domestic product target. Chinese invasion of Taiwan ‘would be catastrophic miscalculation’Read more After the cold war, the west did not collectively spend enough on defence, Truss said, adding: “We also need our allies to step up. I see the 2% as a minimum and I want to see our allies spend more too.” She appeared unimpressed by rhetoric from Johnson and Wallace in recent days. The prime minister has claimed that if Vladimir Putin were a woman, they would not have invaded Ukraine, while Wallace said the Russian leader had “small man syndrome”. “I believe that both men and women are capable of doing evil things,” Truss told LBC, adding: “I don’t pretend that I can conduct a psychological analysis of [Putin]. Nor do I think it’s helpful.” Truss suggested there was no end in sight to the conflict in eastern Europe in which tens of thousands of troops have been killed. She told the Today programme: “We will only successfully end this war when Russia is pushed out and there is a proper peace settlement.” Asked whether that included Crimea, which Russia annexed in 2014, the foreign secretary said there should be no trade-offs or compromises with Moscow. She was also notably hawkish on China and hinted at moves to arm Taiwain to help see off the threat of an invasion. Truss told Times Radio that the “free world” had to “make sure that Taiwan has the ability to defend itself, that we continue to maintain peace in the Taiwan Strait”, adding: “This is a thing that we’re discussing with our allies.” After Johnson’s allies briefed the Telegraph about concerns over whether he would get a fair hearing by the privileges committee, which on Wednesday began its investigation into whether the prime minister misled parliament over Partygate, Truss said she had full confidence in the inquiry. When asked about the Labour MP Harriet Harman being chair of the committee, which has a Conservative majority, Truss said: “I don’t see a problem with that.” Truss added she trusted the cross-party group of MPs to look at the allegations properly and make an appropriate judgment.",,,,

New Zealand has toughened its tone recently on security and Beijing’s growing presence in the South Pacific, in part due to the signing of a security pact between China and Solomon Islands.  At a summit where Nato for the first time identified Beijing as a serious challenge, Ardern dedicated part of her speech to warning of China’s increasingly muscular international presence – while calling for dialogue and diplomacy rather than increased militarisation in response. “China has in recent times also become more assertive and more willing to challenge international rules and norms,” she said. New Zealand must engage in Pacific with humility, not entitlement | Morgan GodferyRead more “Here, we must respond to the actions we see. We must stand firm on the rules-based order, call for diplomatic engagement and speak out against human rights abuses at all times when and where we see them. But we also must resist the temptation to simplify the increasingly complex world in which we live.” Much of the prime minister’s speech was dedicated to calls for diplomacy, multilateralism, and commitment to dialogue, even as the US and other western partners have increasingly hardened their positions on Russia and China. “New Zealand is not here to expand our military alliances. We are here to contribute to a world that lessens the need for anyone to call on them,” she said. “We must use diplomacy at every opportunity, until it has proven to fail.” As well as her remarks on China, Ardern used much of her speech to discuss the conflict in Ukraine – speaking of New Zealand’s commitment to nuclear-free status, and calling on Nato members to “halt in the production of weapons that create our mutually assured destruction”. “I also come with a request: that we do not allow the legacy of the war in Ukraine to become an arms race, or an even more polarised and dangerous world.” Her address reflected New Zealand’s incremental moves to align more closely with “likeminded” partners, said strategic studies prof Robert Ayson, of Victoria University. Ardern’s administration has attempted to walk a delicate line – maintaining open dialogue and strong trade relations with China, while still speaking out on specific disagreements. At times, the government has been accused of taking a “softer” line than some of its allies because of its trade dependency – China is New Zealand’s largest trading partner, accounting for 30% of all exports. The Australian prime minister, Anthony Albanese, attending his first Nato summit in Madrid, echoed some of Ardern’s sentiments with a warning that the strengthening of relations between Beijing and Moscow posed a risk to all democratic nations. “Just as Russia seeks to recreate a Russian or Soviet empire, the Chinese government is seeking friends, whether it be … through economic support to build up alliances to undermine what has historically been the western alliance in places like the Indo-Pacific,” he told the summit on Wednesday. Albanese spoke to reporters after having a meeting on the sidelines with the leaders of Japan, South Korea and New Zealand – the “Asia-Pacific 4”. “There we discussed the important focus of this Nato summit on the Asia-Pacific region. The Russian invasion of Ukraine has solidified the support amongst democratic countries for the rules-based international order,” he said. Ardern’s speech did not represent a radically tough new line on Beijing, Ayson said. “This is not Ardern’s stick-it-to-China moment,” he said, but reflected the tensions of New Zealand’s position. “Wanting de-escalation on the one hand, and then obviously working closely with partners who are trying to compete with Russia and China.” Jason Young, Director of the NZ Contemporary China Research Centre, said New Zealand’s orientation toward China had shifted over the past two years, as it was faced with deep differences on issues including human rights abuses in Xinjiang, the erosion of democracy in Hong Kong, and Beijing’s push to sign security pacts in the Pacific. The country’s outlook had “become more realistic, in terms of the balance of opportunities and risks … there have been more and more issues which have come up which put New Zealand and China in very different positions.” In Beijing, he said, Ardern’s words could be interpreted “as New Zealand becoming more closely aligned with like minded partners like America and Europe,” and “will be concerning for them”. China’s foreign ministry has not commented specifically on Ardern’s speech, but state-controlled media outlet the Global Times ran an editorial on Tuesday rebuking Australia and New Zealand for attending the summit at all.",,,,

While Russia’s war against Ukraine has dominated discussions at the Nato summit, China earned a place among the western alliance’s most worrying security concerns.  “We now face an era of strategic competition … China is substantially building up its forces, including in nuclear weapons, bullying its neighbours, including Taiwan,” Stoltenberg said. “China is not our adversary but we must be clear-eyed about the serious challenges it represents.” The alliance’s last blueprint – or strategic concept – was agreed to in 2010 and did not mention China. The new one states that China’s policies challenge Nato’s interests, security and values, though Russia remains the most significant and direct threat to security. US to increase military forces across Europe, Joe Biden announcesRead more “The PRC’s [People’s Republic of China] malicious hybrid and cyber operations and its confrontational rhetoric and disinformation target allies and harm alliance security,” the strategic concept reads, noting a deepening partnership with Russia in their shared attempts to “subvert the rules-based international order, including in the space, cyber and maritime domains”. Nato warned that the Chinese government was “rapidly expanding” its nuclear capability without increasing transparency or engaging in good faith in arms control, and using economic leverage to “create strategic dependencies and enhance its influence”. US secretary of state Antony Blinken accused Beijing of undermining the rules-based order “that we believe in, that we helped build”. “If China’s challenging it in one way or another, we will stand up to that,” he said. The Australian prime minister, Anthony Albanese, attending his first Nato summit in Madrid, warned that the strengthening of relations between Beijing and Moscow posed a risk to all democratic nations. “Just as Russia seeks to recreate a Russian or Soviet empire, the Chinese government is seeking friends, whether it be … through economic support to build up alliances to undermine what has historically been the western alliance in places like the Indo-Pacific,” he told the summit on Wednesday. Albanese said Australia had been subjected to “economic coercion” from China, and urged democratic leaders to pursue trade diversification. Australia, South Korea, Japan and New Zealand were invited to the Madrid summit to add a greater focus on the Indo-Pacific region. Albanese’s objective was to elevate the region as a second theatre of strategic competition with Nato members preoccupied with Russia’s illegal invasion of Ukraine. Addressing her first Nato summit, New Zealand prime minister Jacinda Ardern warned of a “more assertive” China but urged more diplomatic engagement. New Zealand has toughened its tone recently amid Beijing’s growing presence in the South Pacific, in part due to the signing of a security pact between China and Solomon Islands. Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian responded by saying Nato should stop “trying to launch a new cold war”. “Stop trying to mess up Asia and the world after messing up Europe,” he said. “What they should do is give up their cold war mindset, zero-sum games and stop doing things that create enemies.” Japan’s prime minister, Fumio Kishida, said the invasion of Ukraine had shaken the foundation of the rules-based order. “The security of Europe and the security of the Indo-Pacific cannot be decoupled,” he said in opening remarks. En route to the summit, UK prime minister Boris Johnson said the Russian invasion of Ukraine had shown the need for extra vigilance and caution over potential Chinese action against Taiwan. “I just think it’s very important that countries around the world should not be able to read across from events in Europe and draw the conclusion that the world will simply stand idly by if boundaries are changed by force,” he said. “That’s one of the most important lessons that we pick up from Ukraine.” UK foreign secretary, Liz Truss, was more explicit, calling for faster action to help Taiwan with defensive weapons, a key requirement for Ukraine since the invasion. “There’s always a tendency – and we’ve seen this prior to the Ukraine war – there’s always a tendency of wishful thinking, to hope that more bad things won’t happen and to wait until it’s too late,” Truss told the UK’s foreign affairs committee. “We should have done things earlier, we should have been supplying the defensive weapons into Ukraine earlier. We need to learn that lesson for Taiwan. Every piece of equipment we have sent takes months of training, so the sooner we do it, the better.” With Reuters and AAP",,,,

The Guardian’s Lorenzo Tondo was at the scene, where plumes of black smoke and flames billowed from the once-bustling Amstor shopping centre while emergency crews rushed in to search for victims. As night fell on the city, emergency workers and soldiers combed through blackened debris and twisted metal as the burned-out building was illuminated by floodlights. Dozens of people who feared their loved ones had been inside the building when the deadly explosions ripped through it looked on in grim silence. A giant crane removed sections of the collapsed roof and rescue workers carefully placed fragments of charred human remains found in the rubble on stretchers. The Ukrainian defence ministry said the attack, which is likely to become responsible for one of the war’s highest civilian death tolls in a single strike, was deliberately timed to coincide with the mall’s busiest hours and cause the maximum number of casualties. “We pulled out several bodies, but there are definitely more trapped under the rubble,” said Oleksii, 46, a firefighter. “This is normally a very crowded place.” The search for survivors continues. World leaders were quick to denounce Russia’s strike as “abominable” and a war crime. Russia’s ministry of defence has since claimed, without evidence, that the fire was caused by “the detonation of stored ammunition for western weapons” and the shopping centre was “non-functional” at the time.

Winning back the vital Black Sea island could could loosen the grip of Russia’s blockade on Ukrainian ports and weaken any future Russia coastal land attack, Isobel Koshiw explained. Russia said it had decided to withdraw as a “gesture of goodwill”. Ukraine’s military said the Russians fled the island in two speedboats after a barrage of Ukrainian artillery and missile strikes over Thursday night. “KABOOM!” tweeted Andriy Yermak, the head of the Ukrainian presidential administration. “No more Russian troops on Snake Island. Our armed forces did a great job.” The Ukrainian military shared an image of what appeared to be the island, seen from the air, with several columns of black smoke rising above it. “Currently, Snake Island is consumed by fire, explosions are bursting,” it said. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said the military success “significantly changes the situation in the Black Sea”.

The main thoroughfare of Khreshchatyk Street was buzzing again with busy cafes, businesses and bars. Oleksandr Litvin, a 23-year-old marketing manager, surveyed the weeks of calm and decided it was time to go back to his apartment in the central Shevchenkivskyi district, returning last weekend after months away. “I left Kyiv right after the invasion,” he told the Guardian’s Lorenzo Tondo in Kyiv. “I moved to a village in the Zakarpattia oblast, the westernmost region of Ukraine. My friends told me the capital was quite safe now and I thought maybe it was time for me to return after more than three months. I thought the bombings were over. But I was wrong.” Four explosions in the space of a few seconds in the early hours of Sunday morning catapulted Litvin and the entire city back to a crude reality. Columns of smoke rose over buildings next to his apartment – home to a cluster of universities, restaurants and art galleries – as air-launched Russian missiles fired from the Caspian Sea served as a violent reminder that the Ukrainian capital is still in a conflict zone.

Photograph: Efrem Lukatsky/AP G7 and Nato pledge support for ‘as long as it takes’ The Guardian’s diplomatic editor, Patrick Wintour, reported from Elmau, deep in the Bavarian Alps, where G7 leaders met for a three-day summit. Against the backdrop of the biggest geopolitical crisis since 1945, the summit began with a few shared quips between leaders mocking Putin’s macho image and ended with a surprising choice of dish: Russian salad. Boris Johnson entered the summit warning that Russia was poised to annex more Ukrainian land if the status quo in the balance of forces continues. He warned the west not to show war fatigue, saying the global consequences of letting Russia prevail would be “absolutely catastrophic”. Similarly, the US president, Joe Biden, urged the G7 to show resolve: “We have to stay together, because Putin has been counting on, from the beginning, that somehow Nato and the G7 would splinter. But we haven’t and we’re not going to.” Western leaders vowed to “stand with Ukraine for as long as it takes”, promising to increase the economic and political costs to Vladimir Putin and his regime of Russia’s war in Ukraine. The Guardian’s defence and security editor, Dan Sabbagh, reported on the following two-day Nato summit from Madrid. The US and the UK announced fresh commitments and Nato leaders signed off on creating a new high-readiness force of 300,000 to deter any Russian invasion. However, the Nato summit was largely about the consequences of Russia’s invasion, not for Ukraine but for countries already inside or about to join Nato, Wintour explained. It was about “defending every inch of Nato territory”, as Biden put it. Volodymyr Zelenskiy needs ammunition, not words. As the leaders headed home to their more mundane domestic challenges, it is legitimate to ask how far these promises change the balance of power on the battlefield, or put doubt in the mind of Putin. Turkey gains from lifting Sweden and Finland Nato veto The US president, Joe Biden, thanked his Turkish counterpart, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, for reaching a deal with Finland and Sweden to allow the Nordic countries to end decades of neutrality and join Nato, at a meeting between the leaders on the eve of the military alliance’s summit in Madrid. The trilateral deal saw Finland and Sweden vow to take steps to control support for Kurdish terrorism in their countries after Erdoğan pressed the alliance to take the threat on its southern borders more seriously.

Photograph: Susan Walsh/AFP/Getty Images Patrick Wintour explored how Erdoğan immediately started to reap the rewards for lifting the block when Biden responded to the Turkish president’s lifting of the veto by authorising his officials to say they were willing to help in the modernisation of the Turkish air force. US officials added that they now supported Turkey’s desire to buy F-16 fighter jets and upgrade its air force, after Turkey initially made a request last in October. “The US Department of Defence fully supports Turkey’s modernisation plans,” Celeste Wallander, assistant secretary of defence for international security affairs, told reporters, adding that Turkey’s modernisation of its fighter fleet “is a contribution to Nato security and therefore American security”. US officials rejected any suggestion Washington was backing the contentious warplane request in order to remove Turkey’s objections to Sweden and Finland’s entry to Nato.

246,,,,"Friday, 1 July 2022",2022-07-01,Russia-Ukraine war: what we know on day 128 of the invasion,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jul/01/russia-ukraine-war-what-we-know-on-day-128-of-the-invasion,"At least 19 people, including two children, have been confirmed dead after Russian missile strikes on an apartment building and resort in Odesa in southern Ukraine, according to Ukrainian officials. A further 38 people, including six children and a pregnant woman, were hospitalised with injuries, Ukraine’s security service said. Ukraine’s deputy foreign minister, Yevhenii Yenin, said there were no military targets or infrastructure in the vicinity of the areas struck by missiles. Speaking at the scene, Yenin said rescue operations were ongoing but “we don’t expect to find anyone alive”. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov denied that Russia was hitting civilian targets. “I would like to remind you of the president’s words that the Russian armed forces do not work with civilian targets,” Peskov told reporters.  Ursula von der Leyen has told Ukraine that there is “a long road ahead” for its bid to become a European Union member, but that “Europe will be at your side every step of the way”. In a speech via video link to Ukraine’s parliament this morning, the president of the European Commission said “There is a long road ahead but Europe will be at your side every step of the way, for as long as it takes, from these dark days of war until the moment you cross the door that leads into our European Union.” Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said Ukraine’s path to European Union membership should “not take years or decades” and vowed to make Ukraine’s part of the process “perfect”. He said “Our path to membership should not take years or decades. We have to overcome this path quickly. Make our part of the job perfect. To enable our friends in the European Union to make another historic decision for us just as quickly and in a consolidated way.” Ukrainian forces said Thursday they have pushed Russian forces from Snake Island, a strategic Black Sea outpost off the southern coast. Russia portrayed the pullout from the island as a “goodwill gesture”. Ukraine’s military said the Russians fled the island in two speedboats after a barrage of Ukrainian artillery and missile strikes. The situation in the eastern Ukrainian city of Lysychansk is “extremely difficult” as Russian forces’ continuous shelling makes it impossible for civilians to evacuate, officials say. “There is a lot of shelling and from multiple directions. The Russian army is approaching from different directions towards Lysychansk,” Luhansk’s regional governor, Serhiy Haidai said, adding that Russian forces remained on the city outskirts, where there was currently no street fighting. Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, said on Thursday a new “iron curtain” is descending between Russia and the west, and that Moscow would not trust Washington and Brussels “from now on”. The process “has begun”, Lavrov said after talks with his counterpart from Belarus. “As far as an iron curtain is concerned, essentially it is already descending.” Russia is using inaccurate missiles from old Soviet stocks for more than 50% of its strikes in Ukraine, leading to significant loss of civilian life, a brigadier general in Ukraine’s armed forces said on Thursday. The rate of Russian strikes in Ukraine has more than doubled in the past two weeks, Brig Gen Oleksii Hromov said at a news conference. A cargo ship left the Russian-occupied Ukrainian port of Berdiansk on Thursday for the first time since the city was seized by Moscow’s troops, according to a pro-Russia official. Yevgeny Balitsky, the head of the pro-Russia administration, was cited by Russian state media as saying the first cargo ship to leave Berdiansk was carrying 7,000 tonnes of grain to “friendly countries”, without saying what cargo the ship was carrying. Hungary will speed up its defence development programme, prime minister Viktor Orbán told state radio. “We must radically increase our defence capabilities,” Orbán said. He reiterated that Hungary’s interest was for the war in neighbouring Ukraine to end as soon as possible. Joe Biden declared that the US and Nato allies will stick with Ukraine “as long as it takes” as the military alliance promised hundreds of thousands more troops to defend eastern Europe. The US president also announced on Thursday another $800m of military aid to Kyiv – but questions remained over how much detail there was behind the plan to create a 300,000-strong force to deter any Russian attack. Nato’s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, has said Sweden and Finland are expected to formally sign the Nato accession protocol on Tuesday. After the Nato summit in Madrid, Stoltenberg said leaders had decided to support Kyiv “to make sure Ukraine prevails as an independent sovereign state in Europe”. Turkey’s president has warned that Ankara could still block Finland and Sweden’s accession to Nato if the two countries fail to fully meet his expectations. Recep Tayyip Erdoğan said that if the two Nordic countries reneged on their promises, including to extradite terror suspects with links to outlawed Kurdish groups, Turkey’s parliament could refuse to ratify the deal reached on Tuesday. Estonian and Latvian defence ministers signed a letter of intent on Thursday at the Nato summit in Madrid for joint procurement of medium-range anti-aircraft systems.“The aggression of Russia in Ukraine clearly shows the need for air defence systems,” the Latvian defence minister, Artis Pabriks, said in a statement. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, said France would deliver six Caesar howitzers and a “significant number” of armoured vehicles to Ukraine. He added that the Nato allies meeting in Madrid “unanimously decided” to boost humanitarian and military aid to Ukraine. The UK’s foreign secretary, Liz Truss, said it was a “realistic” ambition to push Russian forces out of Ukraine entirely. Asked whether the British government believed Russia could be pushed out of all of Ukraine within a foreseeable timeframe, Truss replied: “It is realistic, and that is why we are supplying the extra lethal aid we’re supplying.” Russia’s foreign ministry said it had summoned the British ambassador in Moscow, Deborah Bronnert, to protest against Boris Johnson’s “offensive” remarks regarding Russia and Vladimir Putin. A strong protest was expressed to the ambassador over “the frankly boorish statements of the British leadership regarding Russia, its leader and official representatives of the authorities, as well as the Russian people”, it said in a statement. Norway’s foreign minister, Anniken Huitfeldt, has said her nation is not blocking Russian access to Svalbard. On Wednesday, Russia accused Norway of disrupting the delivery of critical supplies and threatened retaliation. Huitfeldt said Norway was not blocking Russian access to the Arctic archipelago, only applying international sanctions, and that Russia had other means to reach its settlements. The Indonesian president, Joko Widodo, arrived in Moscow on Thursday, where he will urge Vladimir Putin to agree to a ceasefire and seek ways to allow the export of grain from Ukraine. Widodo also met with the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, on Wednesday during a visit he described as a “manifestation of the Indonesian people’s concern for the situation in Ukraine”.",,,,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6e77631e00a8b1dc4a9f1318f87e2c986a361a81/0_39_1600_960/master/1600.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=ea6f58acacdd8343010550bf5a41b5bf

A spokesperson for the pro-Russian separatist forces said “Lysychansk has been brought under control,” but “unfortunately, it is not yet liberated.”Despite fierce battles near the city, Lysychansk is not surrounded and remains under control of the army, said Ruslan Muzychuk, the Ukraine national guard spokesman.“The goal of the enemy here remains access to the administrative border of Donetsk and Luhansk regions. Also, in the Sloviansk direction, the enemy is attempting assault actions,” he said. 16h ago22.51Zelenskiy urges resolve amid ‘very difficult path’ to victory As Russia intensifies its attacks on Ukrainian cities, Volodymr Zelenskiy told citizens in his nightly address on Saturday that they must maintain their resolve.

We must help the army, the volunteers, help those who are left on their own at this time.”The country has endured a series of deadly strikes this week.

Ukraine’s democratically elected leader, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, is Jewish, and many of his relatives were killed in the Holocaust.According to the Times, Russian media has been instrumental in the spread of false claims and propaganda in the war, including articles that falsely claim Ukrainian Nazis have used civilians as human shields and are planning the mass murder of Russians. References to Ukrainian Nazism in Russian articles have remained high since the day Russia’s invasion began.“You see it on Russian chat groups and in comments Russians are making in newspaper articles,” Jeffrey Veidlinger, a University of Michigan professor, told the Times. “I think many Russians actually believe this is a war against Nazism.”Russia has engaged in a harsh crackdown on both Russian and foreign independent news outlets since invading Ukraine, and passed a law that media outlets have warned criminalizes independent journalism.Updated at 21.02 BST 20h ago19.01The president of Belarus has claimed, without providing evidence, that Ukraine attempted to strike military facilities on Belarusian territory earlier this week. Reuters, citing the state-run Belta news agency, reported that Alexander Lukashenko said Ukrainian armed forces tried to strike facilities in Belarus three days ago, but that the missiles were intercepted. He claimed Ukraine was attempting to provoke Belarus, and that his country does not plan to intervene in the conflict. Belarus, a close ally of Russia, has supported the war, allowing Moscow to use the territory to wage its war against Ukraine. Vladimir Putin recently pledged to send Belarus nuclear-capable missiles in “the coming months” and offered to provide upgraded warplanes.Last week, Ukraine said that missiles from Belarus hit a border region in its territory.The Ukrainian military did not immediately comment on Lukashenko’s claims.I’m Dani Anguiano and I’ll be bringing you the latest developments in the war in Ukraine over the next few hoursUpdated at 19.03 BST 22h ago17.00CNN reports on the volunteers deep in the eastern Ukrainian forest sleeping in earthen dugouts, primed and ready to defend against the Russian military.

Powerful explosions shook Ukraine’s southern city of Mykolaiv on Saturday morning, its mayor, Oleksandr Senkevych, said. Air raid sirens sounded across the Mykolaiv region before the blasts and residents were urged to stay inside shelters. It was not immediately known what caused the explosions.

Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has accused Russia of engaging in “conscious, deliberately targeted terror” after another in a series of what Kyiv says are Russian missile attacks aimed at civilians. In his nightly video address on Friday, Zelenskiy denounced the strikes on an apartment building and a recreation centre in a small coastal town near Odesa in southern Ukraine that left at least 21 people dead.

Russian forces are continuing to achieve “minor advances” in the strategic city of Lysychansk in eastern Ukraine, with air and artillery strikes continuing in the district, British intelligence says. Ukrainian forces probably continue to block Russian forces in the south-eastern outskirts of the eastern Ukrainian city, according to the latest UK Ministry of Defence report.

The Ukrainian army has rejected claims that Russian-backed separatists and Russian forces have surrounded the key eastern city of Lysychansk. Ruslan Muzytchuk, a spokesman for the Ukrainian National Guard, said fighting rages around Lysychansk but that the city remains under the control of Ukraine. Russian-back separatists earlier claimed they had “completely” encircled Lysychansk.

Russia’s defence ministry has said its forces destroyed five Ukrainian army command posts in Donbas and in the Mykolaiv region, according to Russian state media. Three weapons storage sites were also destroyed in the Zaporizhzhia region in south-east Ukraine, the ministry was quoted as saying. These claims have not been independently verified.

Rescue workers have recovered as many as 29 body fragments amid the rubble of deadly Russian missile strikes on a shopping centre in the Ukrainian city of Kremenchuk, Ukraine’s state emergency service said. At least 19 people were killed on Monday after two Russian X-22 cruise missiles hit a crowded shopping centre in Kremenchuk, officials said.

The UK government has condemned the exploitation of prisoners of war after two more British men held by Russian proxies in east Ukraine and charged with “mercenary activities” could face the death penalty. Andrew Hill of Plymouth and Dylan Healy of Huntingdon were reported to have been charged with “forcible seizure of power” and undergoing “terrorist” training, according to a state news agency in Russian-controlled Donetsk.

A Briton and a Moroccan man sentenced to death by pro-Russia officials in Russian-controlled east Ukraine have appealed against their sentences, Russian state media reported. The supreme court in the self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic has received appeals from lawyers for Brahim Saadoun and Shaun Pinner, according to the Russian state-owned news agency Tass. Another Briton sentenced to death by the Russian proxy court, Aiden Aslin, had not yet submitted an appeal, Tass reports.

A series of recent assassination attempts targeting pro-Russian officials suggests a growing resistance movement against Russian-backed authorities occupying parts of southern Ukraine, according to US officials. The resistance could grow into a wider counterinsurgency that would pose a significant challenge to Russia’s ability to control captured Ukrainian territories, CNN has cited officials as saying.

Ukraine’s army has accused Russia of carrying out strikes using incendiary phosphorus munitions on Snake Island a day after Moscow’s withdrawal of forces. A statement by the army was accompanied by a video that showed a plane drop munitions at least twice on the island, and what appeared to be white streaks rising above it.

The US announced on Friday that it would provide Ukraine with an additional $820m in military aid. The new aid package will include new surface-to-air missile systems and counter-artillery radars to respond to Russia’s long-range strikes in its war against Ukraine. The Pentagon also announced that it will provide up to 150,000 rounds of millimetre artillery ammunition.

Other prisoners were beaten so badly they died, he added. A translator for Kurayan told the paper:Every day he would be called out for the torturing and they wanted him to hand over his friends. Anzhelika Todorashko, 32, said her mother, 52-year-old Viktoria, was captured in February for her work with the Ukrainian army. She was transported to Russia where she said she was given electric shocks, photographed naked, given little food and water, and heard screams from other prisoners asking for death, Todorashko said.Russian soldiers would humiliate prisoners, Todorashko said, with her mother telling her that prisoners had to hold their hands above their head for hours a day. If they dropped their hands they would be beaten, she said. Soldiers also shaved the heads of the women and suffocated others.

Russia claims it has taken full control of Lysychansk, the eastern Ukraine city that had become Ukraine’s last major stronghold in the Luhansk region. The defence ministry reportedly made the announcement on Sunday, after initially stating the area had been encircled.
Ukraine’s defence ministry has denied the claims, saying that the city was not under “full control” of Russia. But spokesperson Yuriy Sak added that if the entire Donbas region were to fall, it would not be “game over” for Ukraine.
It comes after an adviser to Volodymyr Zelenskiy said the loss of Ukraine’s last large bastion in Luhansk was “indeed a threat”. Oleksiy Arestovych added: “I do not rule out any one of a number of outcomes here. Things will become much more clear within a day or two.” 
Former British army chief Lord Dannatt said “meaningful negotiations” could arise out of Russia potentially taking full control of Ukraine’s Luhansk and Donetsk provinces. His comments came before the Russian defence ministry reportedly claimed to have taken full control of Lysychansk, the last major Ukrainian stronghold in the region.
At least three people were killed and dozens of residential buildings damaged in the Russian city of Belgorod on Sunday, the region’s governor said, after earlier reports of several blasts in the city near the Ukrainian border. Vyacheslav Gladkov said at least 11 apartment buildings and 39 private residential houses were damaged, including five houses destroyed. Reuters was not able to independently verify the reports and there was no immediate reaction from Ukraine. Gladkov said earlier on the Telegram messaging app: “Reasons for the incident are being investigated. Presumably, the air defence system worked.”

His comments came before the Russian defence ministry reportedly claimed to have taken full control of Lysychansk, the last major Ukrainian stronghold in the region. Following early defeats in its invasion, Russian troops have been focused on driving Ukrainian forces out of the regions in recent weeks. “They’re relying on their huge superiority in artillery,” said Lord Dannatt. “Then once they’ve almost reduced everything to rubble, then sending their troops in to take possession of it.Former British army chief Lord Dannatt says he believes Russia will take the Donbas and “at that point the war will go into a deep freeze” I genuinely learned a lot from this interview today #Ridge  pic.twitter.com/eIB1TdZCgz— Sophy Ridge (@SophyRidgeSky) July 3, 2022
“We’re going to see that slow grind continue. They’ve very nearly achieved taking Luhansk province and then they will turn their sights to trying to get the control of Donetsk. “I think what we’ve seen over the last few weeks shows that over the next few days and weeks they will probably achieve that.” He added that if Russia takes both provinces, it will have achieved some of what it wanted to achieve in its war on Ukraine but its troops will be exhausted “The Ukrainians will also be exhausted.

The defence ministry said its troops had captured the villages surrounding Lysychansk, encircling the area, and were fighting Ukrainian troops inside the town, Reuters reported.“Russian troops and units of the Luhansk People’s Republic are fighting inside Lysychansk, completely defeating the encircled enemy,” the ministry said in a statement.Damaged residential buildings in Lysychansk, Ukraine, on Sunday, after Russian forces reportedly pounded the city in an all-out attempt to seize the last stronghold of resistance in eastern Ukraine’s Luhansk province.

Those who lived through the Russian occupation are some of the worst affected, on what leading Ukrainian psychologists see as a spectrum of trauma experienced by the whole country, including those who have left.Borodyanka’s centre of psychology was set up in 1994 to deal with the aftermath of Chernobyl. Later, it treated Ukrainian veterans from the war in eastern Ukraine.A man rests on a bench near destroyed residential buildings in the town of Borodyanka.

A volunteer was inside at the time.The psychologists say every resident who stayed in the town is suffering from stress, including post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).“You can visually tell the difference between a person on the street who wasn’t here and a person who stayed [during the occupation],” said Ludmilla Boiko, a psychologist from the centre.

Ukrainian fighters have been trying to defend the city of Lysychansk for weeks in a bid to prevent it falling to Russia, as neighbouring Sievierodonetsk did last week, AP reports. “The occupiers threw all their forces on Lysychansk. They attacked the city with incomprehensibly cruel tactics,” Luhansk governor Serhiy Haidai said on the Telegram messaging app. Plumes of smoke seen rising from Lysychansk, Ukraine, during heavy fighting between Ukrainian forces with Russian troops on Friday (Narciso Contreras/Anadolu Agency via Getty Images) Photograph: Anadolu Agency/Getty Images“They suffer significant losses, but stubbornly advance.

Photograph: Anadolu Agency/Getty ImagesUpdated at 08.30 BST 7h ago07.46SummaryHello and welcome to the Guardian’s continuing coverage of the war in Ukraine. It is approaching 10am in Kyiv. Here’s a summary of the latest developments. 
At least three people were killed and dozens of residential buildings damaged in the Russian city of Belgorod on Sunday, the region’s governor said, after earlier reports of several blasts in the city near the Ukrainian border. Vyacheslav Gladkov said at least 11 apartment buildings and 39 private residential houses were damaged, including five houses destroyed. Reuters was not able to independently verify the reports and there was no immediate reaction from Ukraine. Gladkov said earlier on the Telegram messaging app: “Reasons for the incident are being investigated. Presumably, the air defence system worked.” 
The Ukrainian army has rejected claims that Russian-backed separatists and Russian forces have surrounded the key eastern city of Lysychansk. A Ukrainian national guard spokesman, Ruslan Muzytchuk, said fighting was raging around the city but it remained under Ukrainian control. Russian media showed videos of Luhansk province militia parading in Lysychansk streets waving flags and cheering,
British intelligence says Russian forces are continuing to achieve “minor advances” in Lysychansk amid the continuing air and artillery strikes. Ukrainian forces probably continue to block Russian forces in the city’s south-eastern outskirts, according to the latest UK Ministry of Defence report.
Russia’s defence ministry has said its forces destroyed five Ukrainian army command posts in Donbas and in the Mykolaiv region, according to Russian state media. Three weapons storage sites were also destroyed in the Zaporizhzhia region in south-east Ukraine, the ministry was quoted as saying. The claims have not been independently verified.
The president of Belarus, Alexander Lukashenko, has claimed Ukraine attempted to strike military facilities on Belarusian territory. Reuters, citing the state-run Belta news agency, reported that Lukashenko said – without providing evidence – that Ukrainian armed forces tried to strike facilities in Belarus three days ago but the missiles were intercepted. He claimed Ukraine was attempting to provoke Belarus but his country did not plan to intervene in the conflict.
Rescue workers have recovered as many as 29 body fragments amid the rubble of deadly Russian missile strikes on a shopping centre in the Ukrainian city of Kremenchuk, Ukraine’s state emergency service said. At least 19 people were killed on Monday after two Russian X-22 cruise missiles hit a crowded shopping centre in Kremenchuk, officials said.
The British government has condemned the exploitation of prisoners of war as two more British men held by Russian proxies in east Ukraine and charged with “mercenary activities” could face the death penalty. Andrew Hill of Plymouth and Dylan Healy of Huntingdon were reported to have been charged with “forcible seizure of power” and undergoing “terrorist” training, according to a state news agency in Russian-controlled Donetsk.
A Briton and a Moroccan man sentenced to death by pro-Russia officials in Russian-controlled east Ukraine have appealed against their sentences, Russian state media reported. The supreme court in the self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic has received appeals from lawyers for Brahim Saadoun and Shaun Pinner, according to the Russian state-owned news agency Tass. Another Briton sentenced to death by the Russian proxy court, Aiden Aslin, had not yet submitted an appeal, Tass reports.
A series of recent assassination attempts targeting pro-Russian officials suggests a growing resistance movement against Russian-backed authorities occupying parts of southern Ukraine, according to US officials. The resistance could grow into a wider counterinsurgency that would pose a significant challenge to Russia’s ability to control captured Ukrainian territories, CNN cited officials as saying.

But its united front could collapse when it has to deal with Russia",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jul/03/yes-nato-has-a-new-vitality-but-its-united-front-could-collapse-when-it-has-to-deal-with-russia,"Most summits bill themselves as “historic” and those who attend invariably talk about “forging a new consensus”. But Nato’s Madrid summit can credibly make such claims, for there is no question that a military alliance that only a few years ago was famously dismissed by the French president, Emmanuel Macron, as “brain dead” has regained vitality and reaffirmed its strategic purpose. As the alliance’s secretary-general, Jens Stoltenberg, put it, Nato’s decision to increase its rapidly deployable troops to at least 300,000 to deter any further Russian aggression “constitutes the biggest overhaul of our collective deterrence and defence since the cold war”.  The determination of all of the alliance’s 30 member states to increase defence spending is unprecedented. Even more significant is the reassertion of Nato’s importance as the only institution capable of offering collective defence for the European continent. It is often forgotten that Sweden and Finland already enjoyed a supposedly cast-iron joint security guarantee as part of their membership in the European Union, yet both countries deemed it prudent to seek to join the alliance at the Madrid summit because they understood the difference between EU aspirations and Nato capabilities, backed up by US military might. Still, as Nato leaders know all too well, the alliance’s challenges remain significant. One claim made at the Madrid summit by people such as European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen is that Finland and Sweden’s accession made Nato “more European”. Yet this is a blindingly obvious statement, for all the Nato enlargements since the alliance’s creation happened in Europe. Therefore, each can be portrayed as making the alliance more European. But what each enlargement failed to achieve and what the entry of Sweden and Finland will miss too is to reduce Nato’s overwhelming dependence on the contribution of the United States. The transatlantic alliance reacted well in response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Since March, Nato has not only been present with multinational battle groups in the Baltic states and Poland, but also in Slovakia, Hungary, Romania and Bulgaria. The Nato presence stretches from the Baltic Sea to the Black Sea. The military alliance has also increased the number of soldiers on the ground. Around 10,000 of the 40,000 Nato soldiers are divided among eight battle groups. The battle groups are equipped with different units geared to the respective location’s military needs. Each battlegroup is led by a different nation, providing the bulk of the troops. What each enlargement failed to achieve is to reduce Nato’s overwhelming dependence on the contribution of the United States Yet, although many allies have brought in beneficial assets, the US contribution dwarfs that of all the Europeans put together. Had it not been for the fact that US troops in Europe now number 100,000 – the highest figure since the mid-1990s – it’s doubtful that the alliance could have presented such a united front. Recent pledges to boost defence spending have also been impressive. But, at least for the moment, only nine of the 30 members dedicate 2% of their GDP to defence, and those who fail to reach this threshold include big European nations such as France, Germany, Italy and Spain. The rest, as they say, remains a “work in progress”. . Nato calculates that its members have promised to spend £172.6bn in additional defence expenditure on top of existing defence budgets, with Germany accounting for perhaps half this amount. But the question is how this will be spent and over what period. The easiest way to improve European capabilities would be to use this cash to buy US equipment off the shelf: this offers substantial economies of scale and time. Yet such an approach will go against European aspirations to boost their defence industries; French diplomats are warning that the Ukraine war must not end up as a bonanza for US arms manufacturers. Chances are high that Nato’s eternal “burden-sharing” debate will continue, even if more cash is available. Across the Atlantic, Donald Trump and his disciples are poised to argue – as “The Donald” did when he was in the White House – that Nato is a scam to fleece American taxpayers. Even if he does not stage a comeback, the idea that the US is spending far more than it should to defend fat, wealthy Europeans is likely to feature prominently when a new Congress is elected this November. The sheer audacity of the Russian aggression has allowed the Biden administration to get the cash it needed from Congress. Still, it is taken for granted in Washington that the $40bn package recently approved by Congress for security assistance to Ukraine is unlikely to be repeated. And a future Nato burden-sharing debate is bound to get more acrimonious when it is joined with a parallel discussion about paying for Ukraine’s postwar economic reconstruction, a project estimated at an eye-watering $500bn. Nato has also set itself a huge objective by pledging to increase the number of high-readiness forces to more than 300,000. For this still does not answer the fundamental question of whether, to deter further Russian aggression, the alliance must position significant forces in the countries near Russia permanently. Not doing so could expose existing Nato members to the danger of a Russian occupation for at least a period until help arrives to liberate them, a risk that, given the horrors of Bucha, no alliance nation is ready to contemplate. But keeping multinational troops deployed permanently in central and eastern Europe will be hugely expensive, well beyond current raised spending plans. The idea that the US is spending far more than it should to defend fat, wealthy Europeans is likely to feature prominently when a new Congress is elected In effect, all that Nato has done in Madrid is to issue a promissory note on this score in the hope that both the nature of the promise and the conditions of its redemption could be discussed later. Yet the biggest paradox for the alliance is that the glue that holds it so solidly together – the determination to stand up to Russia’s imperial intentions – remains its most significant vulnerability. Despite all the back-slapping in Madrid there is no consensus on how to deal with Russia. Everyone agrees that it must not be allowed to succeed in its current aggression. But does this mean that it should be physically defeated on the battlefield in Ukraine, as Britain and most of the central and eastern Europeans are arguing, or would it be enough if the war ends without Moscow being able to make a plausible claim to victory, as Germany’s leaders would prefer? For now, this debate seems abstract. But the moment Moscow hints that it wants a ceasefire in Ukraine, all these differing opinions within Nato will come into the open. Nato’s new Strategic Concept adopted at Madrid includes a total of 71 “we will” categorical commitments, spread across just 11 pages of text. An admirable set of pledges, no doubt. But some won’t endure when the guns in Ukraine fall silent.
