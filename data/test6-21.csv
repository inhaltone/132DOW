1,"Wednesday, 23 February 2022",2022-02-23,Putin’s looming threat gives Johnson some breathing space,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/feb/23/putins-looming-threat-gives-johnson-some-breathing-space,,"Boris Johnson is in his happy place. The Russian invasion of Ukraine couldn’t have come at a better time. At a stroke, people have stopped asking him awkward questions about the cost of living and the price of fuel. Better still, both Labour and – more importantly – Tory MPs have also suspended hostilities on Partygate. At a time of imminent war in eastern Europe, a united front must be maintained at home. Just in case Vladimir Putin happens to be watching and starts taking our threats seriously. Not that there’s much sign of that so far. But we can live in hope. So, for The Suspect, the heat is off temporarily. He can swan around doing his Churchill tribute act – “We shall fight them on the tennis courts. We shall fight them in the Tory party fundraising auctions. We shall never give up” – safe in the knowledge that right now it’s hard for him to screw things up too badly. No one is coming after him and there is no vote of no confidence imminent. Because however many lies he happens to tell, they are nothing to those being told by Vladimir Putin. And his corruption is amateur hour when compared with the delusional venality of the Russian president. Though it’s obviously something to which he can aspire.  All of which made prime minister’s questions a curiously subdued affair with both The Suspect and Keir Starmer on their best behaviour. Something that came far easier to the Labour leader as he is by far the more serious politician. Even in an international crisis, Johnson can’t totally conceal his inherent levitas. At heart he still thinks the whole thing is a bit of a game. Starmer began by making it clear he was going to go easy on Boris. For the good of the country. The last thing people wanted to see at such a time was politicians squabbling and point-scoring. So he was thoroughly behind the efforts of the UK and other Nato countries to deter Putin. He was – as he had said the day before – just disappointed that the sanctions had been so feeble. The Russian president must have been delighted. That’s if he had even noticed. Steady on old chap, The Suspect replied. While he was very grateful to have the support of the Labour party in principle, he did want to point out that sanctioning five small banks and three individuals who had already been sanctioned by the US since 2018 was actually a massive deal. Not only had it caused Putin to rethink his invasion plans but it had given other oligarchs time to liquidate their assets and get their cash out of the country. Which was a good thing, no? Johnson didn’t really seem to have much of a grasp how sanctions were supposed to work. In any case, it was important to remember that this was just the first phase of an internationally coordinated response. So our next sanctions would be marginally less pathetic. The UK’s role was to always look a soft touch compared with other countries. The Labour leader then moved on to RT television. Surely it was time to have it banned? As it happened, Nadine Dorries had already written to Ofcom about this, The Suspect said. Though there had to be a place in the UK media for outlets that tolerated lies and made-up stories. Otherwise Johnson would never have had a career at the Telegraph. As for donations from Russian oligarchs, he wasn’t going to pay them back because he was sure the Tory party had never taken them. And just to be on the safe side, he definitely wasn’t going to investigate because who knew what you might find once you started. Sensing that they might be on the verge of kicking lumps out of each other in their usual adversarial style, Starmer and The Suspect backed off. The Labour party offers its full support etc. The government appreciates the opposition’s full support etc. Only the Labour leader managed to sound halfway sincere. In keeping with the mood, most Tory backbenchers went out of their way to avoid asking Johnson anything difficult about Ukraine, parties or the cost of living and in return he congratulated them on doing whatever it was they did. He still gives the impression of having no idea who any of them are. Others weren’t so docile. Caroline Lucas tried to ask about Russian involvement in UK elections. Her question went on a bit and she got drowned out by Tory MPs shouting her down as they tried to protect their leader from all too believable truths. Lindsay Hoyle did himself no favours in his failure to allow Lucas to be heard. The most telling intervention came from Margaret Hodge who wanted to know if it was possible to sanction members of the Duma. “It’s quite a thing to sanction parliamentarians,” said The Suspect. Inadvertently giving away far more than intended. Because few parliamentarians have more experience of getting away with things than Johnson. He knows he’s lied to the police. To parliament. To everyone. And he still reckons he’ll get away unscathed. People in power are untouchable. At heart, Boris is just another oligarch manque. Only without the billions. Rejoicing in his freedom, The Suspect went on to tell some lies. He’d forgotten how naturally it came to him. The UK was the first to appreciate the seriousness of Ukraine. Alex Salmond was a member of the SNP. He was on the point of telling the Labour party Jeremy Corbyn was still its leader when Hoyle called time. Labour’s Chris Bryant made a point of order. For the first time ever, Johnson had apologised for lying to the house. About Roman Abramovich facing sanctions. It had taken the fear of reprisals from a Russian oligarch to get him to do the decent thing. The sanctions were working. Just in the opposite way to what had been intended.",0
2,"Wednesday, 23 February 2022",2022-02-23,From ‘Putin’s chef’ to the RT editor: names expected to appear on EU sanctions list,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/23/from-putins-chef-to-the-rt-editor-names-expected-to-appear-on-eu-sanctions-list,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/050c522ae5cc5e3e940692bbf0ef664bdadd34f2/0_13_4590_2753/master/4590.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=bf48f8e32d7263e332703b46de24aad5,"The EU has approved asset freezes and travel bans on various Russian people and entities in response to Vladimir Putin’s decision to recognise the self-proclaimed republics in Donetsk and Luhansk as independent states. The list of those targeted has not been officially confirmed, but here are five of the most prominent names the Guardian has seen on a draft list.  Sergei Shoigu Russia’s minister of defence has overseen the military buildup on Ukraine’s borders and would manage the war effort if Russia chooses to launch a wider invasion. He is a rare member of Putin’s inner circle who did not serve in KGB, military or intelligence circles. He served as minister for emergency situations from 1991 to 2012, before being appointed defence minister by Putin with the task of modernising the Russian military. Alongside Putin’s senior aides, Shoigu has been involved in key decisions, such as the annexation of Crimea, because of his oversight of the military and the aggressive GRU intelligence agency. He also has direct access to Putin, including during their regular hunting and fishing trips together in Siberia. Shoigu is from Tuva, a Buddhist republic in Siberia that borders Mongolia. Yevgeny Prigozhin ‘Putin’s chef’ is the financier behind a network of paid trolls that allegedly tried to influence the 2016 US presidential election. Photograph: Alexander Zemlianichenko/AP The St Petersburg-based businessman has been dubbed “Putin’s chef” because of the restaurants and catering businesses where he made his fortune in the 1990s. Since then his business interests have expanded into government contracts and other endeavours, allegedly including a troll factory, a private military company, and global influence operations that have landed him on numerous sanctions lists. According to the US Treasury Department, Prigozhin is the Russian financier of the Internet Research Agency, a network of websites and paid trolls that allegedly tried to influence the 2016 US presidential election in favour of Donald Trump. Prigozhin is “also believed to be the financier behind [the] private military company Wagner, a designated Russian Ministry of Defence proxy force,” the Treasury department said. The company’s alleged activities in Ukraine, Syria, Sudan and Libya have “generated insecurity and incited violence against innocent civilians”, the Treasury Department said. Igor Shuvalov Shuvalov is head of Vnesheconombank, a key source of funding for the Kremlin’s projects. Photograph: Evgenia Novozhenina/Reuters Igor Shuvalov is a Russian politician and businessman who is being sanctioned as the head of Vnesheconombank (VEB), the Russian financial institution that is a key source of funding for the Kremlin’s priority projects. Those have included the Sochi Olympics, among others. Shuvalov was previously a first deputy prime minister in both Dmitry Medvedev and Vladimir Putin’s cabinets before he left government and was appointed chairman of VEB in 2018. He was previously one of the most senior liberal figures in government until they were largely ousted in favour of Putin’s security hawks as his dominant advisers. Shuvalov, who was seen as a close Putin ally nearly a decade ago, has owned property in London and was targeted for his wealth by the jailed opposition politician Alexei Navalny, who demanded a police investigation. Maria Zakharova Russia’s foreign ministry spokesperson is a ‘central figure of government propaganda’. Photograph: Russian Foreign Ministry/TASS As tensions over Ukraine reached fever pitch last week, Russia’s foreign ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova issued a “request to the mass disinformation outlets of the USA and Britain – Bloomberg, the New York Times, the Sun etc – announce the schedule of our ‘invasions’ for the coming year. I’d like to plan my vacation.” It was a typically mocking response from the chief spokesperson of Russia’s diplomatic service. Zakharova is a career diplomat but isn’t very diplomatic. She has described a previous US ambassador as “incompetent”, said D-day’s significance should not be exaggerated on the 75th anniversary of the landings, and joked about sending a journalist asking about human rights abuses in Chechyna to the region. A graduate of the prestigious Moscow State Institute of International Relations, who speaks English and Chinese, she is fêted in Russian state media for her combative style, evident in her torrent of Facebook posts attacking western governments. The EU has called her “a central figure of government propaganda”. Margarita Simonyan The editor-in-chief of the RT network is said to have a direct line to the Kremlin on her desk. Photograph: Evgenia Novozhenina/Reuters ​​Margarita Simonyan was just 25 when she was chosen to be the first editor of Russia Today, the state channel broadcasting in English and other languages, later described by the French president, Emmanuel Macron, as an agency of “lying propaganda”. Now known simply as RT, it has offered its small number of viewers in the UK guests from Jeremy Corbyn to Nigel Farage, conspiracy theories and baseless claims about “genocide” in Ukraine. Simonyan, now editor-in-chief of the RT network, is said to have a direct line to the Kremlin on her desk and was given an award by Putin for “objectivity” after the annexation of Crimea. She greeted reports of her imminent addition to sanctions lists with mockery. “Maria Zakharova and I took out our handkerchiefs,” she said, adding it was time to have “a little cry”.",0

4,"Wednesday, 23 February 2022",2022-02-23,EU approves wide-ranging sanctions against Russia over Ukraine,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/23/eu-poised-to-announce-wide-ranging-sanctions-on-russia-over-ukraine,,"Russia’s defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, the commanders-in-chief of the Russian air force and Black Sea fleet, leading state “propagandists” and 351 Duma deputies are expected to be identified in EU sanctions that were approved on Wednesday. The list of names, which has not been officially confirmed, would go further than those announced by the US and a significant distance beyond Boris Johnson’s Russia sanctions.  Guardian graphic Ministers approved the sanctions on Wednesday, but the final list of names will not be published until later in the day. The EU will impose asset freezes and travel bans on 23 people, three banks and a notorious internet “troll factory” in St Petersburg, in response to the Russian president, Vladimir Putin’s decision to recognise the self-proclaimed republics in Donetsk and Luhansk as independent states. The bloc is also expected to sanction 351 members of the Russian state Duma that voted for recognition of the two territories. The Russian government will also be further restricted in its ability to raise money on EU financial markets. EU officials are drawing up measures to restrict trade with the two Russian-controlled territories in eastern Ukraine, mirroring earlier sanctions on Crimea in 2014. EU leaders are expected to discuss further sanctions at a special summit on Thursday evening in Brussels. “Everyone seems onboard for the adoption of sanctions,” an EU diplomat said. At the top of the sanctions list is Shoigu, because he is “ultimately responsible for any military action against Ukraine”, states the draft list seen by the Guardian. He is joined by Anton Vaino, Putin’s chief of staff, who “plays an active role in decision making”, as well as Igor Osipov, the commander-in-chief of the Black Sea fleet, and Sergei Surovikin, commander-in-chief of Russian aerospace forces. Other top officials include the deputy prime minister and chair of state-owned VTB bank, Dmitry Grigorenko, and Igor Shuvalov, the chair of Russia’s state development bank, VEB, which plays an important role in funding its defence sector. The EU is also targeting Russian “propagandists”, including the foreign ministry spokesperson, Maria Zakharova and head of the RT channel, Margarita Simonyan, both known for their strident anti-western rhetoric. Vladimir Solovyov, the pro-Kremlin presenter of the Russia One channel, also features. Other notable figures include Yevgeny Prigozhin, described in US sanctions as the founder and unofficial head of the Wagner mercenary group, which is already subject to EU sanctions for what Brussels calls “responsibility for serious human rights abuses” and extrajudicial killings in Ukraine, Syria, Libya, the Central African Republic and other countries. Prigozhin, known as Putin’s chef, finances the Internet Research Agency, which has also been added to the EU sanctions list. Based in St Petersburg, the IRA is better known as the “troll factory”, where bloggers work around the clock to flood the global internet with pro-Putin and anti-western views. Prigozhin’s mother and wife, who own companies with links to him, are also on the draft list. The sanctioned banks are Bank Rossiya, believed by EU and western officials to be the personal bank for Putin and many of his officials, as well as Promsvyazbank and Vnesheconombank, both considered by EU officials to be instructed personally by the Russian president, with a key role in financing Russia’s defence sector. The new measure constitutes the largest number of people added to the EU’s Russia sanctions, which currently cover 193 people and 48 companies linked to the annexation of Crimea and destabilisation of Ukraine. Many Russian Duma deputies are already subject to EU sanctions. EU leaders have been invited to an emergency summit on Thursday, where they will hold further talks on sanctions. “Expect some more discussions on the broader big bang sanctions package later this week,” said the EU official. Valdis Dombrovski, executive vice-president of the European Commission, said a second package of sanctions, including export controls, would be launched in the event of Russian troops moving beyond the Ukrainian territory held by Russian-backed separatists. “If there is further Russian aggression and further incursion into Ukraine territory we are willing to step up our response also in terms of sanctions,” Dombrovskis told Reuters. Asked what such a stepping up would mean, he said: “It would concern economic sanctions in the area of trade, for example export controls.” Forget the obsession with sanctions against oligarchs. I have a better way to hurt Putin | Angus RoxburghRead more EU ministers unanimously approved the broad outlines of the existing package on Monday, after intense discussions about how to deter Putin. A few countries, notably Lithuania, wanted to hit the Kremlin with the strongest possible sanctions immediately; big member states France, Germany and Italy, however, argued for a more gradual approach. “We want to have the possibility for deterrence so we could respond if there is further action by Russia,” the EU foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, said following the ministerial meeting on Monday. “We said clearly that there will be new sanctions against Russia. We have an arsenal of possible actions. We didn’t want to do everything at once, because I think we have to monitor events as they occur.” Sanctions, Borrell said, would cause economic damage, but had their limits. “Sanctions don’t have miraculous effects,” he said. “It’s not like a red light where everybody stops.” Russia has said it will respond to any sanctions and its ambassador to the US, Anatoly Antonov, has claimed that any sanctions will hit global financial and energy markets.",0

6,"Wednesday, 23 February 2022",2022-02-23,Fighting the threat from Putin will take teamwork. But who trusts Johnson’s Britain?,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/feb/23/europe-vladimir-putin-boris-johnson-ukraine-britain,,"The default view at Westminster and in most of the media is that Vladimir Putin has saved Boris Johnson’s skin, for the present. The reflex on the Conservative backbenches is that the prospect of a European war means this is no time for a leadership change. In reality, of course, the reverse is true. Russia’s seizure of parts of Ukraine this week makes the case for replacing Johnson far stronger. That does not mean it will happen – the police investigating “partygate” and the voters have not yet spoken – but it should. Forget the obsession with sanctions against oligarchs. I have a better way to hurt Putin | Angus RoxburghRead more  Putin’s annexation of the Donbas provinces is an epochal event. It is an assault on a sovereign European state and a western ally. From the Gulf of Finland in the north to the Danube delta in the south, it ratchets up the military threat to a string of other vulnerable European nations. It redefines at a stroke the security and energy assumptions of our entire continent for a decade and more. It also represents a deliberate and culminating self-inflicted rupture by Russia’s autocracy with the western democracies. This has not come out of nowhere. There have been serious pre-eruptive signals since at least 2008 in Georgia, Crimea and elsewhere, including Salisbury. The Ukraine seizure is nevertheless a wake-up call about the absolute and systemic nature of the break. Relations could now descend into a 21st-century cyber cold war, but one in which a catastrophically divided United States – Donald Trump praised Putin’s action this week as “genius” – can no longer be guaranteed to provide the western pillar. All this poses immense difficulties for every western European nation. The west has drifted into this without much thought – and with nothing approaching the degree of strategic hostile planning of Putin’s Russia. But existential challenges have to be faced all the same. They require a serious and sustained strategic response. Yet the current British government – perhaps even British politics in general – is peculiarly unsuited to this at present, and Johnson is alarmingly ill-qualified to grapple with it effectively as prime minister. Johnson’s approach to government has proved to be the same as his approach to journalism and party politics: performative opportunism. He is not, in any traditional sense, a national leader. Just when this country needs a prime minister with a command of national statecraft, it is saddled with a prime minister who knows only stagecraft. In the Commons, he offers a pastiche of public school parliamentarism. In the world beyond, he dresses up as a builder, a doctor, a police officer or a soldier. On Tuesday, as Putin’s tanks rolled west, he went to the Ministry of Defence and dressed up again, this time as a prime minister in a war room surrounded by chaps in uniform. Johnson’s response to Ukraine may appear engaged. But this is deceptive, and is designed to be. His priority is his own survival, not Ukraine’s. Putin has provided him with a heaven-sent distraction, and Johnson will milk it. The crisis plays to Johnson’s innate desire to act the part of Churchill, though in reality, as his feeble early sanctions show, he is aping Churchill’s language while following the policies of Neville Chamberlain. At every turn, he idiotically hypes the narcissism of small differences to assert that Britain is playing a bigger and more distinct role than it really is. Britain was “out in front” he said twice in the Commons on Wednesday. This is precisely the opposite of what this situation calls for. As aspect after aspect of the Ukraine crisis shows, the reality is that Britain is not the autonomous master of its own fate, let alone of Ukraine’s. Britain is in truth what it has always been, before and after Brexit. It is one of a number of European states, though an important one, that must work together, with serious US backing, to limit the Ukraine conflict, to protect the rest of eastern Europe, to contain Russia, and to defend democracy and the rule of law. In other words, British interests are effectively synonymous and coterminous with those of the European Union and just about every sovereign state in our continent. Part of Johnson’s brain seems to understand this. Unity with allies was absolutely vital, he repeated at prime minister’s questions. But even a stopped clock is right twice a day. The problem is caused by what happens the rest of the time. In the wake of Putin’s actions, two needs stand out for Europe as a whole, Britain included. Each is simultaneously immediate and long term. The first is military: to strengthen and deploy sufficient deterrence to limit further assaults on Ukraine’s sovereignty and to uphold the security of countries bordering Russia, from Norway to Romania. That’s where the threat is greatest. The second is continuity of affordable energy supplies without overdependence on Russian gas or any compromising of green energy goals. These have been in-your-face issues for frontline states for years. Now they are top of everyone’s agenda. They cry out for a unified European tough realism to match that of Russia. The EU has been hopeless about this for many years. Germany dashed for Russian gas when the electorate revolted against nuclear power. France and Italy have bad histories of trying to be Russia’s western interlocutor and favoured trading partner. But Britain has its own big glass house too – the City’s Russian money launderers and the other enablers, including the Tory party – and should not throw stones. All of these things demand an allied cooperative response as well as a certain degree of trust. But who trusts Johnson’s Britain? A country that spends its time poking fun at the EU, playing silly buggers in the Channel over migrants, doing a bit of freelance troublemaking in Poland and threatening to trigger a trade war over Northern Ireland is a country that needs to get real, and fast. Be absolutely clear. Johnson’s Britain is acting as Putin’s useful idiot and playing his game of divide and rule. Nothing in this requires any backtrack on Brexit. But we are Europeans all the same. There is no logic in this country pretending we are an independent, freewheeling, great global power at such a time (nor ever was, come to that). No sense, either, in acting as if our greatest alliance is with reactionary Australia, that we are reborn as an Asia-Pacific player or that we are uniquely equipped to bind the US into Europe. These are the deluded and embarrassing fantasies of a post-imperial nation whose leader can only overplay or underplay. This is a time for seriousness and for action to promote collective self-interest. Putin has reminded western Europeans that war has not disappeared, nor ever will. Security cannot be shirked, and should not be merely dabbled with. There’s a generational task ahead now. We need a government, and a prime minister, who are up to the job, because these ones simply are not. Martin Kettle is a Guardian columnist

7,"Wednesday, 23 February 2022",2022-02-23,Ukrainians in UK making plans to return home to take up arms,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/23/ukrainians-in-uk-making-plans-to-return-home-to-take-up-arms,,"A small but growing number of Ukrainians living in Britain are making plans to go back to their homeland to fight the Russian army if its invasion of the country escalates, community leaders have said. They said Ukrainian expats, including veterans of the war with Russia since 2014, would take up arms to defend the country in response to the buildup of Russian troops along and inside eastern Ukraine’s borders.  Wolodymyr Pawluk, chair of the Association of Ukrainians in Great Britain, said many military veterans living in Britain were thinking of going back, with a minority having already decided to do so. “In London, I can only say a handful have said that they will go back,” said Pawluk, 58. “There are many more that I’ve also heard will go, although I don’t know them personally.” Marta Mulyak, the head of the London branch of Plast National Scout Organisation of Ukraine, said: “I do hear men who live not only here but in other European countries saying: ‘Well, if it comes to war, we want to go there. We want to be part of that defence.’” Mulyak, 39, who stressed that the scouting movement was not involved in these plans, added: “The reality is that no one except Ukrainians will defend Ukrainian land.” She said some of her friends and family members in Ukraine’s eastern region had recently joined a new territorial defence force set up by the government in January, whose civilian members will help to combat Russian troops. “Some of my cousins are thinking about it. Some of my friends have already joined. A lot of my friends already joined the regular army. All the men that I speak with in Ukraine say that we will defend our country.” Olesya Khromeychuk said she expected her friends in Ukraine to join the new territorial defence force. Photograph: Handout Olesya Khromeychuk, director of cultural centre the Ukrainian Institute London, also said she expected her friends in Ukraine to join the territorial defence force, adding that some of the artists she has worked with spent last weekend tidying up a bomb shelter. The historian added that the escalation of hostilities had brought back painful memories of family loss. “Just imagining what sort of bloodshed this is likely to cause is awful. I lost my brother, who was serving in the Ukrainian armed forces, at the frontline in 2017. Volodya was 42 when he was killed by shrapnel in the Luhansk region. He lived in western Europe but moved back to join up.” Khromeychuk, 38, who wrote about her brother’s death in her recently published book, A Loss, added: “It’s been a tough few months, because I had to remind everybody that we’ve been in this for eight years. Thousands of people have died. I was really hoping that this would become a matter for memoirs, not for news stories. But that’s not going be the case for some time.” Like many others in the Ukrainian diaspora, Tetyana Vovnyanko, who lives in London, is anxiously monitoring the threat to her family. Vovnyanko, 48, said her brother and most of her other relatives live near Uman, a city between Kyiv and Odessa, which she has heard is a possible target for Russian occupation. She added: “This morning [Tuesday], I spoke with them, and I listened to the Ukrainian analytics, and they said that one of the possible strikes and plans, which Putin has in his mind, will be for the invasion to have Kyiv under Russian troops’ control, and possibly they will be moving towards the town where my family lives. That made me very anxious and nervous.” Vovnyanko, co-founder of British-Ukrainian Aid, which supports people suffering from the armed conflict and humanitarian crisis in Ukraine, said the charity might now pivot towards providing medical supplies and warm clothing to territorial defence forces. “If there will be a battle or invasion, they will be helping out the wounded as well.” Petro Chymera, 32, head of the Ukrainian Youth Association in Bradford, said some members of the local community were preparing contingency plans to help relatives in east Ukraine seek refuge in Western Europe and the UK.“If there was to be an invasion, there’s that worry and that fear, and contingency plans as to [whether it is] possible to head to the west of Ukraine towards Kyiv, or even further to the EU, or whether they could come over here.” Musician Peter Solowka, whose band The Ukrainians was formed a year before Ukraine declared independence from the former Soviet Union in 1991, said the country’s culture of resistance would continue amid the worsening hostilities. The former Wedding Present guitarist, 62, from Oldham, whose father was Ukrainian, said: “The history of Ukrainian culture and music refers to people fighting against oppression. People going off to fight and you cry as you leave your family because you might not come back. “It’s not going to go away just because some tanks turn up in the capital city. There’s been hundreds of years of this culture surviving that sort of thing.”",0
8,"Wednesday, 23 February 2022",2022-02-23,What steps should Britain take to avert war in Ukraine?,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/23/what-steps-should-britain-take-to-avert-war-in-ukraine,,"Thank you Simon Tisdall (The long, bloody history of proxy wars should be a warning to Johnson in Ukraine, 20 February). Boris Johnson’s perennial boosterism is never truthful and I hope this particular mad idea never sees the light of day. Yes, bring Ukraine into Nato and answer Putin’s accusation head-on, or stay entirely out of the argument and protect those states who are already in Nato against the certain interference that will follow. The much criticised offer of helmets by the German government is of the same substance as Johnson’s rhetoric. A proxy war would destroy Ukrainians’ westward, anti-Putin-kleptocracy ambitions. Anthony O’Neill Glasgow  Congratulations to Simon Tisdall for his straight-talking article, largely backing up the wise piece by Simon Jenkins last month (Britain should stay well out of Russia’s border dispute with Ukraine, 20 January). The way out of this crisis isn’t by Johnsonian grandstanding, but by patient diplomacy, as Emmanuel Macron evidently realises, and from the starting point of the Minsk II accords – agreed at the time by Ukraine, but in seven years never implemented. It will happen neither by surrendering to, nor utterly rejecting, the Kremlin’s maximalist demands, but step by step, starting with the running sore of Donbas. It’s clear from Vasyl Filipchuk’s and others’ comments (Ukraine’s leader stood on platform of peace, but finds himself on brink of war, 20 February) that far-sighted Ukrainians realise this too. Robin Milner-Gulland Washington, West Sussex In characterising a hypothetical Ukrainian war of resistance against Russian occupation as a “proxy war” on the part of Britain and other western countries, Simon Tisdall is falling into the colonialist mindset of denying Ukrainians’ own agency and imagining that they would not fight such a war without western support. This is delusional. The idea that postcolonial Ukraine would not fight a war of resistance against an occupation by their former imperial rulers is as ridiculous as the idea that Ireland, Kenya or Vietnam – among many others – would not fight an occupation by theirs. If Russia occupies, there will be a war of resistance until Russia leaves, irrespective of the opinions and actions of foreign governments. Britain can choose to stand up against Russia by arming Ukraine, supporting its entry into Nato and increasing sanctions against Russia, or it can choose to stay neutral in the face of oppression. Either way, Ukrainians will keep fighting for their independence as colonised people always have done and always will do. There can be no peace without justice, in Ukraine or anywhere else. Adam Lawson Hackney, London Short of full-scale invasion at this point, Vladimir Putin may be content to take back Ukraine one bite at a time. He is likely to pause now and see whether the full weight of western sanctions is applied. He can reasonably expect that differences between the US and EU countries will hamper this. If this is the case, he may be willing to delay. A lot can happen in the next few years to his advantage, not least the coming upheaval in the US elections, which could bring a new administration more inclined to let western Europe defend itself. As we are all aware, Putin has wider ambitions than Ukraine and we are entering into an uncertain, if not perilous decade for democracy.David Copsey Brighton Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

9,"Wednesday, 23 February 2022",2022-02-23,Understanding Putin’s narrative about Ukraine is the master key to this crisis,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/feb/23/putin-narrative-ukraine-master-key-crisis-nato-expansionism-frozen-conflict,,"With his incursion into Donetsk and Luhansk, Vladimir Putin has broken international law and destroyed the best negotiating track, the Minsk agreement. That is clear. What is also clear is why he did it. An increasing number of politicians and media analysts claim Putin may be mentally unstable, or that he is isolated in a bubble of yes-men who don’t warn him of dangers ahead. Many commentators say he is trying to restore the Soviet Union or recreate a Russian sphere of influence on his country’s borders, and that this week’s intrusion into eastern Ukraine is the first step towards an all-out attack on Kyiv to topple its government and even move against the Baltic states. None of these assertions is necessarily true.  The Russian president is a rational man with his own analysis of recent European history. Coming from a former Communist, his blaming of Lenin for giving excessive scope to local nationalism in drawing up the Soviet constitution is remarkable. Similarly, his criticism of the way national elites destroyed the Soviet Union in its final years is sharp. Does he want to turn the clock back? People often quote his statement “the demise of the Soviet Union was the greatest geopolitical catastrophe of the century”. But it bears pointing out that he enlarged on it later, saying: “Anyone who doesn’t regret the passing of the Soviet Union has no heart. Anyone who wants it restored has no brains.” It is crucially important for those who might seek to end or ameliorate this crisis to first understand his mindset. What happened this week is that Putin lost his patience, and his temper. He is furious with the Ukraine government. He feels it repeatedly rejected the Minsk agreement, which would give the Ukrainian provinces of Donetsk and Luhansk substantial autonomy. He is angry with France and Germany, the co-signatories, and the United States, for not pressing Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, to implement them. He is equally angry with the Americans for not taking on board Russia’s security concerns about Nato’s expansion and the deployment of offensive missiles close to Russia’s borders. To those who say Nato is entitled to invite any state to join, Putin argues that the “open door” policy is conditioned by a second principle, which Nato states have accepted: namely that the enhancement of a state’s security should not be to the detriment of the security of other states (such as Russia). As recently as 2010 Barack Obama put his signature to the principle at a summit of the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE). The summit’s declaration includes a wonderfully idealistic ambition: “We recommit ourselves to the vision of a free, democratic, common and indivisible Euro-Atlantic and Eurasian security community stretching from Vancouver to Vladivostok”. This echoes Mikhail Gorbachev’s plea, when the cold war division of Europe ended, for Russia and other European states to live together in a “common European home”. We now suffer in the shadow of the thwarting of that dream. Russia’s belief in Nato ‘betrayal’ – and why it matters todayRead more For Putin, Obama’s signing of the OSCE statement is proof of the hypocrisy that goes back to earlier US presidents, who showed the dishonesty of Nato’s “open door” policy by rejecting Russia’s repeated feelers about joining the alliance. In his speech this week, the Russian leader said he had asked Bill Clinton about the possibility of membership but was fobbed off with the argument that Russia was too big. In 2000, during his first weeks as president, Putin was asked by David Frost on the BBC if it was possible Russia could join Nato. He replied: “I would not rule such a possibility out, if and when Russia’s views are taken into account as those of an equal partner.” George Robertson, a former Nato secretary general, recently recalled meeting Putin during his time at Nato: “Putin said, ‘When are you going to invite us to join Nato?’ And [Robertson] said: ‘Well, we don’t invite people to join Nato, they apply to join Nato.’” From outside the alliance, Putin has seen it expand continually. He says he does not seek a revived Soviet Union but a buffer zone that would be, as he put it in a long essay last year, “not anti-Russia”. John Kennedy wanted a similar cordon sanitaire when Khrushchev tried to put nuclear missiles in Cuba in 1962. Putin suggested on Tuesday that Ukraine should return to the strategy of neutrality that was in the Ukrainian constitution until the “coup” that toppled the Yanukovych government in 2014, and brought pro-US nationalists to power. After all, a majority of Ukrainian MPs then believed that the country’s fragile unity would be more secure if it was not pulled and pushed by rival pressures from Moscow and the west. Nato’s stance over membership for Ukraine was what sparked Russia’s takeover of Crimea in 2014. Putin feared the port of Sevastopol, home of Russia’s Black Sea fleet, would soon belong to the Americans. The western narrative sees Crimea as the first use of force to change territorial borders in Europe since the second world war. Putin sees this as selective amnesia, forgetting that Nato bombed Serbia in 1999 to detach Kosovo and make it an independent state. Convinced that Nato will never reject Ukraine’s membership, Putin has now taken his own steps to block it. By invading Donetsk and Luhansk, he has created a “frozen conflict”, knowing the alliance cannot admit countries that don’t control all their borders. Frozen conflicts already cripple Georgia and Moldova, which are also split by pro-Russian statelets. Now Ukraine joins the list. There is speculation about what will happen next but from his standpoint, it is not actually necessary to send troops further into the country. He has already taken what he needs.

With a state of emergency set to be unveiled, the country’s parliament approved a draft law that gives Ukrainians permission to carry firearms. Previously they were forbidden from leaving home with lethal weapons.  Most Ukrainians – boys and girls – learn how to shoot at school. About 400,000 people are estimated to have combat experience, following Vladimir Putin’s 2014 annexation of Crimea and the Moscow-supported armed uprising in the east. But the threat in recent days of a possible attack on Kyiv has caused an unprecedented rush to buy arms. Gun shops have sold out of some weapons, such as AR-10 and AR-15 assault rifles, with business now exceptionally busy. “Of course I’m worried about the situation,” Dariia Olexandrivna said, speaking in the basement Praporshyk gun store, in central Kyiv’s Pushkin street. “I’m hoping for the best but preparing for everything.” The Ukraine-Russia crisis explained: a complete visual guideRead more Olexandrivna said she and her husband began taking shooting lessons six months ago, when tensions with Moscow grew. They owned two handguns. She had come to buy 400 rubber bullets. “I saw Putin’s speech on Monday. I think he’s stupid enough to do it. He hates Ukrainian people,” she said. Two weeks ago she packed the car with clothes, medicines, food, water and extra shoes. “My two children speak only Ukrainian. They don’t speak any Russian. If it’s no longer safe for us we will leave,” she said. Where would she go? “The west of the country, somewhere,” she replied. Over the past 24 hours the Ukrainian government has taken enhanced security measures, having previously downplayed the likelihood of conflict. Restrictions on movement, mass gatherings, political meetings, and concerts and sports matches, are being proposed. Guns for sale at a Kyiv shop. Photograph: Chris McGrath/Getty Images In a speech on Tuesday, the president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, announced the mobilisation of reserves – beginning with 36,000 people, with veterans recalled to active duty. He also told Ukrainian citizens to leave Russia. Dmytro Skatrovsky said he had not been notified by text but had turned up anyway outside the Svyatoshynskyi recruitment centre, in western Kyiv. He spent three years in the army and took part in the 2014 battle to evict separatists from the port city of Mariupol, he said. “I’ve bought two sniper complexes with good optics,” he added. “I’ve also ordered a drone on Amazon. It hasn’t turned up yet.” Skatrovsky said a group of friends had chipped in to get the rifles – at a cost of $10,000 (£7,370). US contacts had paid $2,300 for the drone, he said. The Ukrainian military gave veterans guns, but the process was slow and bureaucratic, he explained. “We can win against Russia. This isn’t 2014,” he said. “We have heavy weapons, thanks to US and UK. If they come we will shoot at them from every window.” Territorial defence courses, where ordinary citizens can learn to shoot are heavily oversubscribed. Buying a gun is legal so long as it more than 80cm in length, with weapons freely available. Police confirm Ukrainians are buying large amounts of ammunition. In February alone 10,000 firearms were registered. Overall, the country has more than 700,000 legal gun owners, the Kyiv defence reporter Illia Ponomarenko tweeted on Wednesday.

The shop sells rifles, pistols, knives, and camping gear, as well as cumbersome safes and a medium-sized brass model of a wild boar. The owner said he had been told not to speak. One customer, Zhenya Nedashkvskyi, said he had dropped in to buy a pump action shotgun. “It won’t stop the Russians,” he admitted. “I want to protect my house from looters. The situation has become hot. It could get worse.” Nedashkvskyi said he would like to protect his elderly parents who live in the city of Smila in the Cherkasy region, about 200km (124 miles) south of the capital. He said he had his eye on a Turkish-made Veryon model, costing 17,520 Ukrainian hryvnia – about $600. “I’ll get that or similar,” he said. Ukraine’s former defence minister Andriy Zagorodnyuk said guns had long been part of national culture. “People are not storming petrol stations or stores but they are buying weapons to protect themselves. That’s a good sign.” Ukrainians attend an open military training session in Kyiv. Photograph: Sergei Chuzavkov/Sopa Images/Rex/Shutterstock He added: It shows that the country is not scared. The nation is ready to fight, if it needs to.” A few shoppers, however, said they were not worried about the situation or the prospect of a looming Kremlin offensive. Alex – a 23-year-old casino manager, who declined to give his second name – said he was buying a sniper file for his father, a keen hunter. “I’m still calm,” he said. He added: “Guns are popular in Ukraine. We all get classes at school on how to shoot. My father has a big collection of weapons already. The rifle is a gift for him.” Asked what would happen if Russian troops did turn up, he said: “I think our people will shoot back.”",0

Unusually low gas reserves have raised alarm among several European governments in recent months, with storage tanks across the continent on average at only 31% capacity at the start of this week – roughly half as full as in 2020.  In Germany, reserves have been particularly low in storage tanks run by the Russian state-owned energy giant Gazprom, seemingly highlighting the country’s restricted room for meaningful sanctions in the case of an escalating conflict on the Ukrainian border. But after the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, on Tuesday announced a freeze on certifying the Nord Stream 2 pipeline between Russia and Germany, and former Russian president Dmitry Medvedev threatened an ensuing doubling in European gas prices, German politicians and economists have struck a note of defiance. Nord Stream 2 map According to calculations by the Institute of Energy Economics at the University of Cologne shared with the Guardian, current levels of gas held in European reserves “could compensate for a loss of Russian deliveries” over the next six weeks unless temperatures were to drop dramatically in February or March. The institute’s analysis chimes with a cautiously optimistic report by the German Economic Institute, also published on Wednesday. While a complete loss of Russian gas imports, currently making up almost half of Germany’s gas needs, “will lead to bottlenecks in some European countries”, the Cologne-based institute says such supply shortages “would be limited to up to 10% of demand”. “German citizens not being to heat their homes this year is not a realistic scenario,” the study’s author, Andreas Fischer, told the Guardian. “But European governments have to make sure reserves are topped up again for the next winter.” Fischer said he was encouraged by the growing imports of liquid gas, of which Europe imported a record volume of 11bn cubic metres this January. The report voices scepticism over how quickly Germany will be able to wean itself off natural gas, predicting that its needs will decrease only by 6% to 17% by 2030. “Natural gas will continue to be the central energy source for heating supply in the coming years.” A renewed confidence that energy dependence would not restrain political action in response to Russia’s recognition of the self-proclaimed republics in Luhansk and Donetsk in east Ukraine was shared in Berlin and Brussels, reported Der Spiegel. “The fear of a stop of gas deliveries appears to have melted away like remaining snow at the end of the winter”, wrote the news magazine. A report by the Kiel Institute for the World Economy even asserts bullishly that Russia stopping gas deliveries would hit the Russia’s economy harder than Europe’s. “A trade stop with gas would result in a slump in Russian economic output of just under 3%”, the study claimed. “For Germany and the EU, there would hardly be any economic damage.” According to the northern German institute’s calculations, a gas embargo would lead Russia’s gross domestic product (GDP) to slump by 2.9%. Germany’s GDP, it argues, would slightly increase by 0.1%, as western allies would replace Russian imports with those from each other.",0
12,"Wednesday, 23 February 2022",2022-02-23,UK firms warned of Russian cyberwar ‘spillover’ from Ukraine,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/feb/23/uk-firms-warned-russia-cyberwar-spillover-ukraine-critical-infrastructure,,"British officials are concerned about “spillover” from any heightened Russian cyber-activity in Ukraine, as demonstrated by last week’s attack on two banks by hackers linked to the GRU spy agency. Although there have been no Ukraine-related Russian attacks on the UK since the start of the crisis, cyber-specialists have been holding meetings with key companies to discuss the possible threat and how it could be tackled.  “Organisations need to understand there is a heightened risk,” said one official, with a particular focus on monitoring whether an intense Russian cyber-attack on Ukrainian targets could have wider consequences. Jeremy Fleming, the head of the spy agency GCHQ, held a roundtable last week to discuss the threat with organisations responsible for Britain’s “critical national infrastructure”, which includes the communications, energy, food, health and transport sectors. Ukraine has been a target for regular Russian cyber-attacks since the start of the war in 2014 and last week was hit with a “sophisticated” attack that tried to disrupt customer services at two Ukrainian banks and the website of the defence ministry. On Friday, the NCSC, Britain’s cybersecurity agency, said it believed Russia’s GRU military intelligence was behind the “denial of service” attack. But although relatively serious, officials believe it was “not necessarily a precursor” for a military offensive or enhanced cyber-action. A recent NCSC briefing, which is considered still valid, said: “While the NCSC is not aware of any current specific threats to UK organisations in relation to events in and around Ukraine, there has been an historical pattern of cyber-attacks on Ukraine with international consequences.” In 2017, Russian state actors launched the NotPetya malware against Ukrainian companies, but it spread indiscriminately around the world, affecting a string of western companies and even some Russian corporations. Western spy agencies have previously said that attack was also conducted by GRU operatives. Ukraine’s long experience in dealing with cyber-attacks – two of which, in 2015 and 2016, briefly disrupted some power supplies – means that western officials believe Kyiv is relatively experienced at picking up the pieces after a damaging attack. Nevertheless, the UK and the US have been helping the country’s cybersecurity agencies, as the crisis has intensified. On Tuesday, six EU countries said they, too, would offer further assistance. A western official said: “We share our understanding of the threats and we have and continue to make them aware of threats.”",0
13,"Wednesday, 23 February 2022",2022-02-23,The brave woman who symbolises Ukraine: Mark Neville’s best photograph,https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/feb/23/brave-woman-symbolises-ukraine-mark-nevilles-best-photograph-kremlin-falsehoods,,"This was taken in May last year in Myrnohrad, an industrial town 50 miles from Donetsk, a stronghold of the illegal Russian occupation in eastern Ukraine. Then, as now, fears of a Russian invasion were high. While much of the west thinks the threat of conflict started only a few weeks ago, it’s been the reality for Ukrainians for almost a decade. I was walking around Myrnohrad taking photos with a big portable flash and a plate camera when I saw this woman sit down and light a cigarette. She looked so confident and self-absorbed. I speak a little Russian, so I told her I was taking pictures of ordinary life across Ukraine and asked if she would pose. She agreed without hesitation.  Normally, when you ask people to pose they do just that – pose – and become self-conscious. But for this woman, it was as if I wasn’t there. It was perfect: she was completely in her thoughts. I love the blue case in her lap, though I never found out what was in it. Maybe it’s a lease for an apartment. Maybe it’s divorce papers. Whatever it is, it felt like she was on a mission. To me, she is a great symbol for Ukraine, a country that is now my home. I suspected that she had been through some tough journeys but remained resilient, brave and generous. It’s difficult to get shots this candid and the photograph was nearly used as the cover of my new book, Stop Tanks With Books. It’s a series of photographs from across the country intended to help westerners empathise with Ukrainians. Falsehoods propagated by the Kremlin have come to define how the rest of the world sees Ukraine. The idea that all Ukrainians are fascists is complete nonsense. Those myths only exist to help foment the inertia that has left the country abandoned in the face of Russian aggression for years. I don’t want to lose my adopted home nor see my friends and their families lose their lives defending their independence My own relationship with Ukraine began in 2015 when I was invited to visit by a military hospital in Kyiv. They had heard about my book Battle Against Stigma, which documented war trauma and the mental health struggles of veterans. The hospital was dealing with troops returning from the war in Donbas in the east and requested a Ukrainian-language version for its patients. I was amazed: in Britain, 500 copies of the book had been impounded on arrival in the UK at the request of the Ministry of Defence, but here was a post-Soviet country thinking so progressively about how to treat their veterans. As soon as I arrived in Ukraine I fell in love – with the people, the food, the culture and the history. I took every opportunity to come back. When the New York Times asked me to shoot people on holiday in their own country, I could’ve gone anywhere and I think the editors were surprised when I decided on Odessa. Eventually, I couldn’t shake the thought: “Why am I living in London when I could be living in Kyiv?” So a year and a half ago, I took the plunge and moved. I don’t have a second home in London. Ukraine is my home and this work is deeply personal. The British government, like others, has advised all its subjects to leave immediately, and to my mind this has fanned the flames of panic. I, like many others, am staying put. I do not want to lose my adopted home, nor see my friends and their families lose their lives defending the country’s rightful independence. Ukrainians are a proud, brave people; they won’t run away. If Russian forces invade further it will be a bloodbath. Ukrainians aren’t asking for British soldiers to come and lay down their lives. But they do want the support of western powers in repelling a Russian invasion. I hope Stop Tanks With Books adds weight to those calls. It is not a neutral work, I have picked a side. I’m pro-Russian but anti-Kremlin. Throughout my career, I have seen the role of the artist as one of counteracting state propaganda. When I embedded with the paras in Afghanistan in 2010, I found the gap between what I saw and what was reported mind-blowing. What changes people’s minds about a conflict is a poem, a song, or a photograph. It’s people’s feelings that need to be changed. To my mind, that’s the role of the artist.

Trump said he saw the escalation of the Ukrainian crisis on TV “and I said: ‘This is genius.’ Putin declares a big portion of the Ukraine … Putin declares it as independent. Oh, that’s wonderful.”  The former US president said that the Russian president had made a “smart move” by sending “the strongest peace force I’ve ever seen” to the area. Republicans criticize Biden but party divided over Russia and Putin – liveRead more Trump, a long-term admirer of Putin who was impeached over allegations he threatened to withhold aid to Ukraine unless it could help damage the reputation of Joe Biden, praised the Russian president’s moves while also claiming that they would not have happened if he was still president. “Here’s a guy who’s very savvy … I know him very well,” Trump said of Putin while talking to the The Clay Travis & Buck Sexton Show. “Very, very well. By the way, this never would have happened with us. Had I been in office, not even thinkable. This would never have happened. “But here’s a guy that says, you know, ‘I’m gonna declare a big portion of Ukraine independent’ – he used the word ‘independent’ – ‘and we’re gonna go out and we’re gonna go in and we’re gonna help keep peace.’ You gotta say that’s pretty savvy.” Trump’s intervention was criticized by the two Republicans serving on the House select committee investigating the January 6 Capitol riot, who are among the few Republicans who have been critical of the former president. Liz Cheney tweeted that Trump’s statement “aids our enemies. Trump’s interests don’t seem to align with the interests of the United States of America.” Adam Kinzinger, meanwhile, retweeted a screenshot from the House Republicans that showed Biden walking away – which was captioned with the comment: “This is what weakness on the world stage looks like” – to denounce it in fiery terms. Kinzinger wrote: “As still ‘technically’ a member of house Republicans, let me, with all my might, condemn this damn awful tweet during this crisis. You can criticize policy but this is insane and feeds into Putins narrative. But hey, retweets amirite?” During a lengthy speech on Monday that questioned Ukraine’s right to exist, Putin said he recognized the independence of two breakaway regions in Ukraine’s east – the Donetsk People’s Republic (DNR) and the Luhansk People’s Republic (LNR) – and that Russian troops will be sent there for “peacekeeping operations”. The move has been roundly condemned by western leaders as a dangerous escalation of the tense situation at the border between the two countries and a violation of Ukraine’s sovereignty. Linda Thomas-Greenfield, the US ambassador to the United Nations, said that Putin’s declaration was “nonsense” and that Russia was “creating a pretext for war”. Boris Johnson, the British prime minister, said that Russia was “plainly in breach of international law” by trying to break off the two territories. Other than Cheney and Kinzinger, most other Republicans and leading conservative figures have vacillated between condemning Biden as being weak in his response to the situation and claiming that Putin is being vilified in a conflict that should not interest the US. “Hating Putin has become the central purpose of America’s foreign policy,” said Tucker Carlson, the rightwing Fox News host on Tuesday. “It’s the main thing that we talk about. Entire cable channels are now devoted to it. Very soon, that hatred of Vladimir Putin could bring the United States into a conflict in eastern Europe.”",0

Dorries’ letter to the regulator said RT was “demonstrably part of Russia’s global disinformation campaign”, and that it appeared clear the channel would seek to continue this role amid events in Ukraine. “I have concerns that broadcasters such as RT, whom Ofcom have found to have repeatedly breached the broadcasting code in the past, will also look to spread harmful disinformation about the ongoing crisis in Ukraine here in the UK,” Dorries wrote. Ukraine crisis live: Russian defence minister and military chiefs among those to face EU sanctionsRead more Johnson announced the review after being challenged by Starmer over RT. “We must also do more to defeat [Vladimir] Putin’s campaign of lies and disinformation,” Starmer said. “Russia Today is his personal propaganda tool. I can see no reason why it should be allowed to continue to broadcast in this country.” The decision to review RT’s licence was welcomed by Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland’s first minister, and other senior figures in the Scottish National party. Sturgeon said she was “appalled” her former mentor Alex Salmond, her predecessor as first minister, still hosted a weekly chat show on RT. She urged Salmond to quit and said no UK parliamentarian should appear on it. Stewart McDonald, the SNP’s defence spokesman at Westminster, agreed. “It is not a normal news service and we should stop treating it as such,” he said. The pressure on Salmond intensified after Alex Cole-Hamilton, the Scottish Liberal Democrat leader, called for him to be expelled from the privy council, a constitutional body which gets confidential intelligence briefings and advises the queen. Salmond was appointed a privy counsellor in 2007 but is no longer an MP. He has not responded to these criticisms. In PMQs the Labour leader also questioned Johnson over the extent of sanctions imposed on some Russian banks and a handful of individuals, announced on Tuesday. “The prime minister promised that in the event of an invasion, he would unleash a full package of sanctions. If not now, then when?” Starmer asked. Johnson responded by saying the UK was “out in front” on sanctions, saying that further measures would be taken but that it was also necessary to impose them in union with allies. Starmer called for the government’s delayed economic crime bill to be brought forward to help tackle complex networks of Russian money in the UK, and also demanded tougher rules on donations from shell companies. “As it stands, the bill would allow unfettered donations from overseas to be made to UK political parties from shell companies and individuals with no connections to the UK,” Starmer said, calling for the government to back amendments to the bill, currently in the Lords, to tighten this up. Johnson declined to do so, and instead mocked Starmer over the recent revelation that the Labour MP Barry Gardiner had received donations approaching £600,000 from a UK-based lawyer whom, it emerged, was working for the Chinese government. Starmer replied by saying that Putin feared “openness and democracy”, and that the UK response should not be partisan. “So will the prime minister work across the house to ensure that this is the end of the era of oligarch impunity by saying that this house and this country will no longer be home for their loot?” Johnson replied: “I don’t think that any government could conceivably be doing more to root out corrupt Russian money.”",0
18,"Wednesday, 23 February 2022",2022-02-23,Forget the obsession with sanctions against oligarchs. I have a better way to hurt Putin,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/feb/23/obsession-sanctions-oligarchs-putin-hurt-russian-leader-ukraine,,"Since the annexation of Crimea in 2014, the western response to Vladimir Putin’s growing list of crimes has been to impose sanctions on his “cronies”. In recent years there have been particularly insistent demands for sanctions on rich Russian oligarchs resident in London. So the UK government’s response this week to Putin’s recognition of the separatist republics in Ukraine’s Donbas region took the usual form: sanctions against five Russian banks and three oligarchs.  The cries went up at once: not enough! Why not Abramovich? What happened to the unexplained wealth orders, recent legal tools intended to expose and punish money-launderers? On this site the Labour MP Chris Bryant demanded much tougher action against the Russian oligarchs who abuse British laws to buy property here and hide their ill-gotten gains. Despite the furore, we rarely pause to ask some very simple questions: are these measures actually the right sanctions? Are they targeting the right people? And, crucially, have they ever had any effect on Putin’s behaviour? The answer to all three questions is no. First, imposing sanctions on oligarchs has little effect on Russian policy. Some Russian oligarchs are close to Putin, and some of them probably help hide his wealth in offshore accounts. Putin uses them to finance projects that he needs done quickly – infrastructure for the Sochi Olympics, a bridge to annexed Crimea. But it is an entirely one-way relationship. Putin allows them to prosper on two conditions: that they cough up the cash when he needs it, and that they stay out of politics. The idea that they influence his policies is pure fantasy. The proof of that is that sanctions regularly meted out on oligarchs since 2014 have made not one jot of difference to Putin’s policies. The west imposed sanctions over Crimea, the downing of a Malaysian passenger jet over Ukraine and the attempted murder of Sergei Skripal in Salisbury. None of them elicited so much as an expression of regret, far less a change of course. What they did do, of course, was deepen Putin’s already simmering hatred of the west. Of course, money launderers who profit from the UK’s lax regime should be exposed and prosecuted. But not all of them are Russian. And none of them have a say in Kremlin decision-making – certainly not in his foreign policies. You only had to look at the quaking members of Putin’s security council on Monday, as they were forced to stand one by one at a lectern and profess their support for his decision to recognise the Donbas republics, to understand that Putin takes orders from no one. Not from his closest political team, and certainly not from rich Russians based in London. The only real value in punishing oligarchs is that it makes the west feel and look good because it is doing something. Economic sanctions – cancelling the Nordstream II gas pipeline, or restricting Russia’s access to the Swift system – may have a greater effect, but they may also rebound on us in the form of higher energy prices. However, there is a much bolder and more imaginative approach. Russia’s ruling class – the members of the Duma, the Senate, the presidential council, the top echelons of the security and defence services, top state television employees – is several thousands strong. These men (and some women) draft, rubber-stamp, promote and carry out Putin’s decisions. Some of them also – unlike the oligarchs – actually advise him. Being a member of the Duma or Senate is a pretty cushy number – you are well-paid, you can make an occasional speech if you wish, but you are basically there to vote for the Kremlin’s decisions, and, above all, you can extort as many bribes as you can cope with. (For this reason they are detested by a majority of Russians.) Members of the presidential council are civil servants, essential for the preparation of legislation. The security services play crucial roles in executing Putin’s vision. And TV propagandists spread disinformation. UK will stop Russia selling sovereign debt in London, says Liz TrussRead more These are the people to target – because when several thousand of the people Putin actually depends on begin to feel the consequences of his policies in their personal lives, there will be a groundswell of discontent. Most of these people love to travel to Europe and the US. They educate their children here. They own properties here. The members of the Russian elite, their families and children, love to swan around on yachts, ski slopes and fine hotels in the west, posting pictures of themselves on Instagram. If they are denied visas to travel to the west – if they are effectively imprisoned in Russia – it will not take long for the discontent to permeate the entire political class. The message to them will be clear: if you want to enjoy your western lifestyles, you need a new leader who respects western values; until then, you’re banned. The added value of this approach is that, unlike some economic sanctions, it will not harm ordinary Russians, in fact it will delight them. If any kind of sanctions are going to have an effect, it is these. Forget the oligarchs; go for the political elite. Angus Roxburgh is a former BBC Moscow correspondent and consultant to the Kremlin.

As the Conservative party came under increasing pressure to sever links with wealthy Russian donors, the foreign secretary announced that a ban on the sale of sovereign debt, issued as bonds by governments in foreign currencies to finance growth and development, was part of a package of measures announced after Putin deployed military forces into two territories in eastern Ukraine on Tuesday.  “We’ve been very clear that we’re going to limit Russian access to British markets,” Truss told Sky News. “We’re going to stop the Russian government with raising sovereign debt in the United Kingdom. “There will be even more tough sanctions on key oligarchs, on key organisations in Russia, limiting Russia’s access to the financial markets, if there is a full-scale invasion of Ukraine.” 00:49Truss rejects claim Russia-linked Tory donations influenced sanctions policy  – video The prime minister and the Treasury had called in finance bosses and regulators to discuss how to ensure recently announced sanctions against Russia were effective, the BBC reported. In order to limit sovereign debt sales in London, Britain would need additional legislation, according to western officials. Boris Johnson revealed a package of asset freezes on five Russian banks and three wealthy people on Tuesday but faced criticism from Conservative MPs for not going further. Truss said the government was taking an “escalatory approach” with international allies, adding that she believed Putin was “hell-bent” on a full-scale invasion of Ukraine, including the capital, Kyiv. “We will agree a further package in the event, which we think is highly likely, of a full-scale invasion into Ukraine,” she told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. “We don’t want to be in the situation … where we’ve got nothing left in the locker. She added: “Nothing is off the table in terms of who we’re targeting.” The former foreign secretary Jeremy Hunt told the Today programme that if the UK was to avoid “being two steps behind in the diplomatic chess game” it had to take Putin by surprise. “The most important is to do sanctions – economic and financial sanctions – that are tough enough and last long enough to reduce the ability of the Russian state to finance the Russian military. And that means we have got to be prepared to dig in for the long term.” The Conservative party is also coming under increasing pressure to break links to Russian oligarchs who have donated more than £2m to the party. On Wednesday the shadow foreign secretary, David Lammy, said there was “too much connection between Russian oligarchs” and donations to the Conservative party. Ukraine president calls up reservists as sanctions coalition against Russia grows Read more “Give it back [and] send a message that we’re serious,” Lammy told Kay Burley on Sky News. “It sends a statement.

Asked by Burley on Sky News if the party would be returning the donations, Truss avoided the question and said all donations were made by British citizens and were properly declared. Pushed on whether the oligarch Roman Abramovich was facing sanctions, as Johnson stated in parliament, Truss said the prime minister “misspoke” and the record would be corrected. Asked whether the Champions League final – due to be held in St Petersburg on 10 June – should go ahead in Russia in light of the crisis in Ukraine, Truss said: “I’m very clear it shouldn’t be.”",0

Prime minister Scott Morrison unveiled the “first tranche” of sanctions on Wednesday, bringing Australia in line with the US, UK and European allies’ initial responses to Russian president Vladimir Putin’s actions in relation to Ukraine.  Australia imposes sanctions on Russia in response to Ukraine crisisRead more Western powers have responded with outrage to Putin’s moves to recognise as independent the republics of Donetsk and Luhansk and send so-called “peacekeeping” troops into Ukrainian territory to secure the new statelets’ proclaimed borders. Australia’s sanctions would target specific Russian individuals, corporations and industries in the hope of pressuring the Russian government to stop “behaving like thugs and bullies”, Morrison said. Here’s what we know about Australia’s new sanctions on Russia, what they’re designed to do, and what their impact might be. What are the sanctions? Eight members of the Russian Federation’s security council will be targeted with financial sanctions. Australian law will now prohibit dealing with these individuals financially, as well as facilitating another person to deal with these individuals or assets they own or control. In effect this freezes their assets in Australia – which can include property as well as financial holdings. Travel bans will also be placed on the eight individuals, barring them from entering Australia. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Several Russian financial institutions will also be barred from transacting with Australian banks. The banks are the Russian State Development Bank, VEB, the military bank Promsvyazbank, Rossiya, IS Bank, the General Bank and the Black Sea Bank. Morrison announced Australia would extend sanctions that it already had in place for Crimea and Sevasatopol – Ukrainian territory which Russia annexed in 2014 – to include the breakaway Donetsk and Luhansk regions now recognised as independent by Russia. The expansion of those sanctions would focus on sectors including transport, energy, telecommunications, oil, gas and mineral reserves, Morrison said. What are other countries doing? After Russia announced it would recognise the breakaway regions as independent states and send in “peacekeeping” troops, the US, UK and EU said they would introduce sanctions. The US president, Joe Biden, announced sanctions that target VEB (Russia’s state development bank) and the Russian military bank, as well as the country’s sovereign debt and five Russian elites and their families, saying: “Who in the Lord’s name does Putin think gives him the right to declare new so-called countries on territory that belonged to his neighbours?” Ukrainians ready for resistance: ‘The whole country will be fighting back’Read more The EU and the UK also announced sanctions in a show of concerted western resolve, with EU foreign ministers banning Russian bond trades in the European market, and the British prime minister, Boris Johnson, unveiling a package of asset freezes on five Russian banks and three individuals. Germany also announced it would halt the approval process for the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline from Russia. Morrison said Australia’s sanctions “ensure that we are in lockstep with the United States and the United Kingdom in the sanctions that they are imposing”. Both Morrison and foreign powers, including Biden, have warned of a ramp up in sanctions if the situation in Ukraine deteriorates. What’s the point of targeting sanctions in this way? The first tranche of sanctions were designed to target “persons and entities of what is termed strategic and economic significance to Russia”, according to Morrison. In relation to the eight members of Russia’s security council, Morrison said these individuals were being targeted because the body had “provided policy advice and justification” to Putin which led to him recognising the breakaway republics – a decision which “fundamentally undermines Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity, and it has no validity under international law”. Dr William A Stoltz, from the Australian National University’s national security college, said the sanctions “clearly focused on pressuring those people who are part of Putin’s inner circle”. “These would be the people that we would want to prevail upon Vladimir Putin to take a different course of action … the people who are powerful enough to put pressure on Putin to retreat, so it makes sense to put the screws on them personally.” Will Australia’s sanctions have an impact? Stoltz said Australia’s sanctions alone were unlikely to significantly sway Russia’s behaviours – noting the relatively small trade volumes between the two countries. Is Russia invading Ukraine and what will happen next?Read more “Our economic exchange with Russia is pretty small, so we don’t have a great deal of leverage over Russia in that regard.” However, he said Australia bringing in similar sanctions to those introduced by the US and European nations was important. “For sanctions to have an effect you need to create a situation where there isn’t a safe haven country for those designated by the sanctions to turn to. So Australia has to be in lockstep with the European and North American countries.” If major countries are united, will that be enough? Stoltz is pessimistic that the initial wave of sanctions will have a significant impact. He notes Australia implemented sanctions against Russia in response to the MH17 passenger flight that was shot down while flying over eastern Ukraine in 2014. “We implemented concerted sanctions over MH17, and to put it brutally honestly, they’ve not been very effective. The Russians still haven’t come to the table for the investigation, they’ve really prevented justice for the families of the victims,” Stoltz said. What more can be done with sanctions? A large part of the ineffectiveness of sanctions against Russia, Stoltz said, had been the country’s economic resilience to foreign financial punishments. “Over the past 20 years Russia has hardened itself to the impact of sanctions, and the Russians are quite used to sanctions by now, they almost wear sanctions like a badge of honour, especially in a situation such as now where they’re kind of martyring themselves in the national interest,” Stoltz said. Oligarchs had previously been the target of foreign sanctions – with their lives in foreign countries upended and assets frozen – in an attempt to pressure them to use their influence over the country’s leadership.

Rules have been continuously tightened, and there’s a sense in Russia that it is hurting that class as they’re not able to live the luxurious life they’re used to. “So far that hasn’t affected Putin, who has put in place protections for the oligarchs to get around sanctions … and technologies like crypto [currency] make it difficult to police the sanctions. But that could stop if he goes too far and sanctions further impact the oligarchic class. He is getting older and he doesn’t have an anointed successor.” While western sanctions were designed “to influence wealthy elites by stopping them from buying homes and going Christmas shopping overseas”, Stoltz said sanctions could go much further. “There is probably going to have to be an attempt to target everyday Russian people, the general population, perhaps by constraining their access to certain everyday goods. That’s an ethically challenging thing to do. “Short of doing that, economic sanctions against Russia, especially by Australia, are largely symbolic at this point.”",0

Scott Morrison met with the cabinet’s national security committee on Wednesday before declaring the Russian government was “behaving like thugs and bullies” and there “must be consequences for Russia’s actions”.  Morrison characterised the sanctions as only the first step of Australia’s response and indicated Australian security agencies were on alert for possible counter-actions by Russia such as espionage and cyber attacks. The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, earlier this week recognised the independence of two Russian-controlled territories in east Ukraine and sent in what he called a “peacekeeping” mission. Is Russia invading Ukraine and what will happen next?Read more Australia will begin by imposing travel bans and targeted financial sanctions on eight members of the Russian Federation’s security council – a body that is chaired by Putin and has 12 permanent members including the foreign minister Sergei Lavrov. Morrison did not specify which eight members would be sanctioned, but said the body had provided Putin with policy advice and justification leading to Monday’s presidential decree that “fundamentally undermines Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity”. Australia will also amend its existing sanctions regulations to cover the breakaway regions of Donetsk and Luhansk, prohibiting trade in sectors including transport, energy, telecommunications, oil, gas and mineral reserves. The government says it will broaden the scope of people and entities that Australia can list for sanctions to include those of “strategic and economic significance to Russia”. Australian individuals and entities will be banned from doing business with Rossiya Bank, Promsvyazbank, IS Bank, Genbank and the Black Sea Bank for Development and Reconstruction. This is in addition to restrictions on Australians investing in the Russian state development bank VEB, according to a statement issued by the Australian government late on Wednesday. Morrison acknowledged Australia did not have a large volume of trade with Russia compared with the US and Europe. But he said it was “important that we play our part in the broader international community to ensure that those who are financing and profiting from an autocratic and authoritarian regime that is invading its neighbour should have nowhere to run and nowhere to hide”. “Australians always stand up to bullies,” he said. “This is only the start of this process.” The announcement follows moves by the US, the UK and the EU to introduce a first round of sanctions. The US president, Joe Biden, said he was determined to “cut off Russia’s government from western financing”. Major parties united The major Australian political parties are united on the issue. Senior Labor opposition frontbenchers were briefed by senior officials on Wednesday afternoon. The opposition leader, Anthony Albanese, said he supported the sanctions because Australians should stand united against “aggressive Russian action which undermines security in the region and indeed the world”. “The aggressor here is Vladimir Putin,” Albanese said in a press conference alongside the shadow foreign minister, Penny Wong. “Calling it peacekeeping is quite farcical. It is anything but. This a peace-breaking intervention in violation of international law.” After weeks of Morrison telling voters Labor would be weak on national security, Albanese said: “We believe it is important when it comes to national security that we express a common view on behalf of the Australian people.” The Greens, too, condemned Putin’s “military aggression” against Ukraine “as we condemn all military aggression”. The “peacekeeping” mission means Russia will formally occupy sovereign Ukrainian territory for a second time after the 2014 annexation of Crimea. Putin said on Monday that he saw Ukraine as “an inalienable part of our own history, culture and spiritual space”. “These are our comrades, those dearest to us – not only colleagues, friends and people who once served together, but also relatives, people bound by blood, by family ties,” the Russian president said.

Photograph: Aris Messinis/AFP/Getty Images Putin had been seeking a range of security guarantees from the west, including curbing the expansion of Nato and a promise that Ukraine would never be able to join the military alliance. But Morrison said on Wednesday accepting such demands from Russia would reduce Ukraine to “a nation in name only”. The prime minister said the Chinese government’s language about respecting Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity had improved over the past week, but Beijing should go further in denouncing Moscow’s actions. He said the Russian government “should be called out as thugs and bullies”. The top official at Ukraine’s embassy in Canberra said his government was grateful for Australia’s sanctions. Volodymyr Shalkivskyi, the chargé d’affaires at the embassy, told Guardian Australia the impact of the sanctions would “depend on the unity and determination of the international community” to react to Russian aggression. “We believe that expansion of the sanctions by our international partners is needed in order to deter the Kremlin from further escalation,” he said on Wednesday. Ukrainians ‘top of the pile’ for visa applications Morrison said he had instructed the immigration minister, Alex Hawke, to put 430 Ukrainians citizens who have applied for an Australian visa at “the top of the pile” for a decision. The government was looking at various options for humanitarian support, including through skilled migration and student categories, he said. Any Ukrainian nationals in Australia who have a visa due to expire by 30 June will be granted an automatic six-month extension. On Tuesday, the Australian government directed its officials to leave Ukraine “due to the increased risk”. Officials have been deployed to eastern Poland and Romania to provide assistance to Australians who are trying to leave Ukraine. Morrison said Russia’s ambassador to Australia, Alexey Pavlovsky, was being called to a meeting with the head of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade in Canberra on Wednesday – but was not being expelled at this stage. Can anything stop Putin’s advance intoUkraine?Read more He said the Russian government was “an autocratic, authoritarian government that has forgotten what democracy is and what liberal democracy is”. Pavlovsky denied last month that Russia’s troop buildup near Ukraine’s border was a sign of aggression and said Australians should look beyond “comic book-style propaganda” about “liberal democracies versus autocracies”. At the time, the Russian ambassador said it was wrong to portray Russia’s concerns about Nato’s eastward expansion as irrational and said any Australian sanctions would be a “gesture” with no impact on Moscow’s behaviour.

Volodymyr Zelenskiy ruled out a general mobilisation in an evening address to the nation. But the decision to bring reservists back into active duty was a further sign that Ukraine was bracing for a possible military clash with its neighbour. It came after Russia began moving troops into the country’s east.  On Tuesday, Vladimir Putin said that Russia will support the territorial claims of self-proclaimed republics in Luhansk and Donetsk, dramatically increasing the likelihood of a larger war in the near future. Joe Biden denounced the move as an attempt to carve out “a big chunk” of the country. The US president said he was bringing in tough new sanctions against Russia for “beginning” an invasion of Ukraine but that there was still time to avoid war. “Who in the Lord’s name does Putin think gives him the right to declare new so-called countries?” Biden said, announcing sanctions on two Russian banks and sweeping measures to stop Russia raising capital in western markets. Early on Wednesday, Russia’s US ambassador, Anatoly Antonov, dismissed the sanctions, saying: “I don’t remember a single day when our country lived without any restrictions from the western world. We learned how to work in such conditions. And not only survive, but also develop our state.” US secretary of state Antony Blinken cancelled a meeting planned for Thursday with Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov, saying Russia’s actions indicated it was not serious about a diplomatic path to resolving the crisis. The White House said a summit between Biden and Putin, proposed by the French president, was “certainly not in the plans at this point”. Speaking alongside Ukrainian foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba in Washington, Blinken warned the crisis was the “greatest threat to Europe since world war two”. He said: “[Vladimir Putin’s] plan all along has been to invade Ukraine, to control Ukraine and its people, to destroy Ukraine’s democracy, which offers a stark contrast to the autocracy that he leads.” The warnings came as Australia, Canada and Japan joined the US, UK and European Union in announcing sanctions against Russia and after Germany halted the approval process for the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline. After Boris Johnson, the British prime minister, announced on Tuesday that three billionaire allies of the Russian president and five Russian banks would face punitive measures, his foreign secretary, Liz Truss has written in the Times that the UK is also considering sanctions for members of the Russian Duma and Federation Council, and extending Crimea’s territorial sanctions to the separatist controlled territories in the Donbas. “No UK individual or business will be able to deal with these territories until they are returned to Ukraine,” she said. Truss said the UK was willing to “[turn] up the heat” on a “long list” of people complicit in the actions of the Russian leadership. The UK was willing to introduce other “measures to limit Russia’s ability to trade and prohibit a range of high-tech exports, degrading the development of its military industrial base for years”. Australian prime minister Scott Morrison said on Wednesday the Russian government was “behaving like thugs and bullies” and there “must be consequences for Russia’s actions”. Eight senior Russian security officials and the oil and gas sectors will be targeted in the first round, he said, and security agencies were on alert for possible counter-actions by Russia such as espionage and cyber-attacks. Justin Trudeau said Canada was sending hundreds more troops to eastern Europe to bolster Nato forces and imposing new sanctions. The prime minister said: “Make no mistake this is a further invasion of a sovereign state and it is completely unacceptable.” Trudeau said trade links with the two Russian-controlled territories in east Ukraine would be severed, the purchase of Russian sovereign debt banned, and Russian MPs and state-backed banks targeted. Japan targeted Russian government bonds and trade and people linked to the self-proclaimed republics in Luhansk and Donetsk. “We strongly urge Russia to return to diplomatic process in resolving the development,” said prime minister Fumio Kishida. ‘We’re not afraid of Putin’: defiance on the streets of KyivRead more For weeks Zelenskiy has urged calm, and a search for diplomatic solutions, even as western allies issued increasingly urgent warnings about Russian invasion plans. Now he has told his country it must “increase the readiness of the Ukrainian army for all possible changes in the operational situation”. He added: “We need to promptly replenish the Ukrainian army and other military formations.” Zelenskiy’s defiant speech came after the US said on Wednesday that the invasion it had forecast for weeks had finally begun. Zelenskiy said that Ukraine is a peaceful country, but its people would not stay quiet in the face of aggression. “If we remain silent today, we will disappear tomorrow. We have hard work ahead, every day, but we are read for it, with confidence in ourselves, our country and victory,” he said. Zelenskiy also said he had held a cross party meeting to propose a defence coalition government and announced the launch of an “economic patriotism” programme of tax breaks and other incentives to bolster a country battered by the threat of war. Ukraine is losing billions of dollars a month as Europe’s worst security crisis in decades has prompted many who are able to flee the capital, Kyiv, moving to other cities or out of the country entirely. He urged businesses to defy diplomatic warnings to foreign citizens to leave the country, after many embassies moved west to the city of Lviv; US diplomats even sleep in neighbouring Poland and commute to their jobs.",0
27,"Wednesday, 23 February 2022",2022-02-23,Harsh conditions mean Russian troops near Ukraine will need to be moved soon,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/23/harsh-conditions-mean-russian-troops-near-ukraine-will-need-to-be-moved-soon,,"Russian forces massing near Ukraine’s borders can only remain in position for a few days before they have to be sent back to nearby bases or risk their capability being significantly degraded, western officials and experts believe. That means that President Vladimir Putin will come under increasing pressure to use them in a full invasion of Ukraine – or send them back to staging areas, still in Russia’s south or west, but tens or even hundreds of kilometres back.  Such advance positions, often with poor protection from the cold, can be held only for a short period – and there is some evidence on social media of the poor conditions endured by soldiers near the border. Postings spotted by military analyst Rob Lee on Monday showed about 100 soldiers camped out – or rather lying down – at a train station about 20km from Ukraine’s border, without rations and having to buy food for themselves. Russian troops based in Belarus, in forests near the town of Khoyniki, 50km from the Ukraine border, were described by one local a few days ago as people who “drink a lot and sell a lot of their diesel fuel”, suggesting a lack of discipline despite the heightened political tensions. Western intelligence estimates that roughly a third of the overall Russian forces are now believed to be “tactically deployed” in frontline positions “poised for operations”. Their movements have been monitored closely using aerial and other reconnaissance for several weeks, as they edge closer to the border. On Monday, one senior official said they believed it would only be possible for Russia to maintain them in their forward positions for “a matter of days” – a conclusion that is endorsed by independent experts. Nick Reynolds, a land warfare analyst with the Rusi thinktank, said: “If the troops are to be used then they will likely be used very soon, while they are as fresh as possible” and concurred with the assessment that commanders would want to move them on in “a few days” if they are to be effective. The Guardian view on Ukraine: the shadow of war looms larger | EditorialRead more Latvia’s defence minister, Artis Pabriks, agreed the next few days were crucial. He argued Putin will test western reaction to his recognition of the separatist territories and the formal deployment of Russian forces there. “They will have a small period of reconnaissance and thinking what the west is doing and what the west is planning. They will assess our responses. And if these responses will not be strong enough or convincing enough, then the next stage will be more incidents on the de facto Ukrainian border,” he said. It remains perfectly possible for Russia to reverse the frontline deployment and return troops to the staging areas they occupied in January, in a similar way to what happened last spring, ready to escalate at short notice once they have resupplied. But, either way, military pressures mean the next few days are likely to be significant.",0

Nearly a decade of war has also left Ukraine with nearly half a million combat-experienced veterans, many now preparing to fight again, officially or unofficially.  That combination, and the sheer size of Ukrainian territory, means that even if Russia can outgun Ukrainian forces on a conventional battlefield, any military clash could lead to a protracted and bloody partisan conflict. “The Russian army has better weapons and technical equipment than us, so we may lose battles or campaigns. But they can never win the country if the Ukrainian people are motivated,” said Serhiy Kryvonos, a retired special forces general and former deputy secretary of the national security and defence council. Kryvonos is travelling the country speaking to veterans and organising weapons training to prepare for a popular uprising should Russia invade. “Look at the experience of Afghanistan. It could not be held by the Soviet Union, by the USA, by the United Kingdom,” he said. “They could not beat the Taliban because they were well motivated. Their strongest weapon was their partisans, civilians by day, then at night they took up weapons to shoot or bury a bomb in the road.” Ukraine’s government, after months of calling for calm, this week shifted its public position and began preparing the country for war. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy announced he was calling up a first group of reservists and on Tuesday the national security council asked parliament to bring in a state of emergency nationwide. Many of those called up had been preparing for weeks, including Roman Nabozhniak, who has made detailed plans for his brownie business to operate without him. Vladimir Putin had brought the country together in the crisis, he said. “Among my friends and peers, there are no arguments now between those who supported Zelenskiy and those who supported [former president Petro] Poroshenko, we have set them aside. Now we have to back this government with one voice. “Unity is our most powerful weapon. Russia wants us to have lots of internal arguments they can exploit.” Putin’s years of aggressive policy have not only shaped and sharpened national identity – politicians in Kyiv sometimes joke he is a founder of modern Ukraine – but also helped hone the military he may now order Russian soldiers to fight. In 2014, when Russia seized Crimea and Russia-backed forces took control of the east, the Ukrainian army was in such degraded form that soldiers weren’t even getting food. In the years since the collapse of the Soviet Union, discipline had frayed, weapons systems had gone without maintenance for decades, and hardly any of Ukraine’s soldiers had seen combat. “The Ukrainian military in 2014 and the Ukrainian military now are two entirely different things, although without [that army] we wouldn’t have a country at all,” said Taras Chmut, a veteran and military analyst with Come Back Alive, an NGO in Kyiv that supports frontline fighters with equipment and training. “We had a big army, with lots of equipment, but it was old and wasn’t in good condition. Food wasn’t getting to the frontline; people were fighting in jeans,” he said. “Even basic supplies weren’t reaching soldiers, from body armour to first aid kits and communications equipment.” 03:20'We're not afraid of Putin': Ukrainians protest in front of Russian embassy in Kyiv – video Today, logistics and training have been improved, and the army has expanded by about 100,000 soldiers, to number about 260,000. Chmut estimates that a total mobilisation including veterans and security forces could put more than 1 million Ukrainians in arms. But when it comes to hardware, Ukraine is still extremely vulnerable. It has a long coastline but, after Russia seized Crimea and its ports, almost no naval capacity. It has no missile defence system, and anti-aircraft defence systems are mostly Russian-made, outdated, and impossible for Ukraine to repair as it cannot get parts. If Russia gains control of the skies over Ukraine, Chmut says he fears civilian slaughter like that seen in parts of Syria, where Russian weapons were used in rebel-held areas. “We are trying to highlight that we need to work on strengthening our air force,” he said. “It doesn’t matter how many people are ready to fight: if the enemy control the airspace, it could be like in Syria, bombing of towns and cities with [a] great number of deaths among civilians.” Kryvonos was concerned that civilians could be targeted with punitive measures, even if they were not targeted by weapons. “They don’t even need to open fire. You can cut off Kyiv’s electricity outside the city,” he said. “The larger the city, the easier to create panic and bring it to its knees. If you cut off power it will become a nightmare in a few days, with no water and no heat.” He said governments had not done enough to warn civilians to prepare supplies of food and water, or even put up signs to bomb shelters. That is particularly worrying because in addition to Russia’s superior force of arms in conventional airspace, it could unleash devastating cyberattacks that would make it harder for Ukrainians to access information as any invasion unfolds. While the government is not moving fast enough for him and many other Ukrainians, people are making their own plans and preparations for the resistance that Chmut says would follow a Russian attack “If it comes to an invasion, it will be total war like in 1939. The whole country will be fighting back, there will be a massive resistance. The west should know there will be a large number of refugees, too, maybe 5 to 10 million.” Those determined to fight include Oleg Sentsov, a film director from Crimea who became a national hero after he was detained in his home city in 2014 and convicted of terrorism in a Russian military court. Human rights groups denounced it as a show trial. He spent five years in Russian jails, including in Siberia where the cold severely damaged his health, before he was released in a prisoner swap in 2019. He says he is ready to fight, even as his latest film, Rhino, is feted at festivals. “I will be in uniform. I have some military training and I know how to act in war,” he said in an interview at a central Kyiv cafe, hours before Putin announced his plans to recognise breakaway regions of Ukraine. “The main thing I learned in this life is not to be afraid. In such a difficult time, I will not be the person running from my country.”",0

34,"Wednesday, 23 February 2022",2022-02-23,Biden’s Russia sanctions: why holding back could be part of his strategy,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/feb/22/joe-biden-russia-first-sanctions-ukraine-analysis,,"Numerologists will be fascinated that Joe Biden began his Ukraine speech on Tuesday at 2.22pm on 22.2.22. The US president, however, was more concerned with his own calculation of the economic and political costs of overreacting – or underreacting – to Russia’s provocations. Biden thought he would be remembered as the pandemic president, but finds himself commanding the arsenal of democracy in what could become the biggest military assault in Europe since the second world war. The crisis escalated on Monday after Vladimir Putin recognised two breakaway territories in eastern Ukraine as independent entities, an apparent pretext for invasion.  “Who in the Lord’s name does Putin think gives him the right to declare new so-called countries on territory that belonged to his neighbours?” Biden demanded in the east room of the White House. “This is a flagrant violation of international law, and it demands a firm response from the international community.” But the response he delivered did not go as far as some in Washington would have liked, receiving a cautious welcome from Democrats and failing to satisfy Republicans who accuse Biden of appeasement. It was a shot across Putin’s bows but also the work of an administration keeping some of its powder dry. Biden announced sanctions that target VEB (Russia’s state development bank) and the Russian military bank, as well as the country’s sovereign debt and five Russian elites and their families. On the last point, the elites “share the corrupt gains of the Kremlin policies and should share in the pain as well”, Biden said. These oligarchs, who live the high life in London and elsewhere, represent a potential Achilles’ heel for Putin. Sheldon Whitehouse, a Democratic senator, told the Guardian last week: “I think he depends on having good relations with the big thieving oligarchs because if they all conspired to defeat him, he’d have to do a lot of oligarch killing and they’d see that coming. His whole world gets pretty well rocked hard. That’s his point of weakness: pressure on the oligarchs.” For now, Biden threatened tougher steps if Russia “continues its aggression” and warned: “We’ll continue to escalate sanctions if Russia escalates.” The logic here is that sanctions lose their potency as a deterrent if they are imposed too quickly: if somebody has been punished for something they haven’t yet done, they might as well do it anyway. But with the window for diplomacy rapidly closing, it may soon be too late for deterrence to mean anything. Washington’s response did not have as much bite as the European Union’s . It did not grab attention like Germany’s steps to halt the process of certifying the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline from Russia – a lucrative deal long sought by Moscow. The US has not severed Russia from the Swift banking system, used to move money around the globe, nor has it imposed export controls, which would have cut Russian firms off from key high-tech equipment and software. Bob Menendez, a Democrat who is chairman of the Senate foreign relations committee, told the MSNBC network that it is “a good first tranche of sanctions but cannot be the end of it”. Republicans, who have been less opportunistic than usual in dinging Biden over Ukraine – perhaps sensing that the issue does not animate their base – may now be running out of patience with his determination to avoid too much too soon. Kevin McCarthy and other Republican leaders in the House of Representatives issued a joint statement earlier on Tuesday that said: “Sadly, President Biden consistently chose appeasement and his tough talk on Russia was never followed by strong action. Lethal aid was slow-walked, anti-air and anti-ship capabilities were never directly provided, pre-invasion sanctions proportionate to the aggression Putin had already committed were never imposed, and sanctions on Nord Stream 2 were waived.” And Mitch McConnell, the Republican minority leader in the Senate, revived a Republican talking point about the chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan. He was quoted by Punchbowl News as saying: “I don’t believe Vladimir Putin would have a couple of hundred thousand troops on the border of Ukraine had we not precipitously withdrawn from Afghanistan last August, but that’s where we are. Looking for signs of weakness.” The Afghanistan debacle precipitated a decline in Biden’s approval rating from which he has not yet recovered. But he does appear to have learned lessons from that failure with a policy of radical transparency about intelligence, close coordination with allies and warnings to Americans that there will be no rescue operation in Ukraine. All this has enabled him to play the role of global statesman and seasoned foreign policy hand. It has offered an unexpected boost to Biden’s promise to reunify Nato after the doubts and disarray of the Donald Trump years. But he may yet take further hits domestically if the crises forced gas prices even higher. “Defending freedom will have costs for us as well, here at home,” Biden said. “We need to be honest about that.” Honesty, however, may not be enough to win over a distracted and divided electorate.",0

The moment came overnight, when Russian troops began attacking Ukraine by land, air and sea. For the US president – increasingly embattled at home by a resurgent Republican party – it was evidence that the White House had largely assessed the Ukraine crisis correctly, even though their preference would have been to be wrong about their predictions of a disastrous war in Europe.  Biden to address nation as Russia invades Ukraine – US politics liveRead more Now the conflict has dumped a huge foreign policy crisis into an already difficult second year in office for Biden, with a likely backlash looming in November’s midterm elections. With few exceptions, though, he largely has the Democratic party behind him and the Republicans are split, with many backing Biden even as others take various potshots at his presidency. But, for the moment, there is the immediate invasion to deal with. On Thursday morning, Biden met in the Situation Room with his National Security Council to discuss the latest developments in Ukraine. He then met virtually with the leaders of the G7, where they agreed to move forward on “devastating packages of sanctions”. Biden was preparing to deliver remarks from the East Room of the White House this afternoon. “President Putin has chosen a premeditated war that will bring a catastrophic loss of life and human suffering,” Biden said in a statement. “Russia alone is responsible for the death and destruction this attack will bring, and the United States and its allies and partners will respond in a united and decisive way. The world will hold Russia accountable.” Biden has pledged that the US would not send troops to Ukraine, warning that to do so would risk a wider war in Europe. But the US has provided arms supplies and sent additional troops to the Baltic states as part of his promise to “defend every inch of Nato territory”. “Sacred” was how the US president described the US commitment to Nato’s article 5, in which an attack on any member nation triggers an allied military response. Domestically, the Biden administration has so far been praised for its decision to quickly declassify intelligence, revealing Putin’s secret plans in real time. Though it was not enough to deter Putin, it helped Washington forge a united front against Moscow in the shadow of the administration’s disastrous withdrawal from Afghanistan last year that left the US weaker in the eyes of many allies and foes around the world. But after multiple high-profile intelligence failures, the US’s assessment proved largely correct. And when Biden said he believed that Putin had already made the decision to attack, it appears he was right. The accuracy of the intelligence shared by the US, and the unity of the transatlantic alliance, may help give the US renewed credibility on the world stage, where Biden has repeatedly warned that democracies are under threat. In Congress, members have broadly condemned Russia’s attack on Ukraine and urged the Biden administration to implement the long-promised paralyzing sanctions. Many Republicans have criticized the administration’s response so far as too little too late, even though senators failed to agree to a bipartisan sanctions package against Russia before leaving Washington for a week-long recess. They settled instead for issuing a strongly worded statement. Underscoring the deep polarization Biden faces at home, a number of Republicans tried to blame him for enabling Putin, including many of the same officials who remained silent as Trump praised and flattered the Russian president. “I have earlier criticized the president and I will repeat some of that,” Senate minority leader Mitch McConnell said Thursday. “I think the precipitous withdrawal from Afghanistan in August … was an invitation to the autocrats of the world that maybe this was a good time to make a move.” McConnell nevertheless claimed to be united with Biden. “We are where we are… We’re all together at this point and we need to be together about what should be done.” House minority leader Kevin McCarthy, however, made no mention of the US president in a statement condemning Russia’s invasion of Ukraine as “reckless and evil”. “Putin’s actions must be met with serious consequence. This act of war is intended to rewrite history and more concerning, upend the balance of power in Europe. Putin must be held accountable for his actions,” he said. Mitt Romney said: ‘The ’80s called and we didn’t answer.’ Photograph: Jon Cherry/Reuters In a bizarre interview on Fox News, Donald Trump mistakenly stated that it was the US, not Russia, invading Ukraine. He was quickly corrected, but spent much of the appearance airing old grievances and attacking his successor. Repeating the baseless claim that the election was stolen, Trump concluded: “It all happened because of a rigged election.” US stock markets dropped sharply on Thursday as investors waited to hear more about what sanctions Biden would impose on Russia. After the assault began, the price of oil passed $100 a barrel for the first time since 2014, a rise that will drive up fuel prices even as the US wrestles with the worst inflation in decades. Investors were reassured by Biden’s comments that sanctions would not affect the oil and gas markets and stocks recovered their losses as the oil price fell. US trade with Russia is relatively small but the conflict’s impact on oil prices was driving up gas prices even before the invasion and there will – no doubt – be more troubling days ahead. In a press conference last week, Biden warned Americans that war in Europe would have consequences for US consumers, already suffering from soaring inflation. “I will not pretend this will be painless,” he said. The federal government has also warned government agencies and operators of critical infrastructure to take proactive security measures against potential cyberthreats from Russia. Biden said he would do everything to alleviate the economic pinch, including to tap the US national oil reserves, which he has already done in his effort to combat the fastest increase in US inflation in three decades. Higher prices pose an immediate political and economic challenge for the president, whose approval ratings have slumped amid rising gas and food prices. Republicans have blamed Democrats for inflation, which is top of mind for voters ahead of this year’s midterm elections in November. Additional reporting by Dominic Rushe",0

Russia was widely expected to launch a cyber assault alongside its military campaign, and the run-up to the invasion of Ukraine was marked by the deployment of “wiper” malware . A distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack, which paralyses websites by bombarding them with spurious information requests, also hit Ukrainian government sites.  On Thursday, requests for volunteers from Ukraine’s hacker underground began to appear on forums in a bid to help protect critical infrastructure and conduct cyber spying missions against Russian troops, Reuters reported, citing two sources. “Ukrainian cybercommunity! It’s time to get involved in the cyber defense of our country,” one post read. Yegor Aushev, co-founder of a cybersecurity company in Kyiv, told Reuters he wrote the post at the request of a senior defence ministry official who contacted him on Thursday. Aushev’s firm Cyber Unit Technologies is known for working with Ukraine’s government on the defence of critical infrastructure. On Wednesday, ESET Research Labs, a Slovakia-based cybersecurity company, said it had detected a new piece of data-wiping malware on hundreds of machines in Ukraine. ESET said large organisations had been affected, while security experts at Symantec’s threat intelligence team said the malware had affected Ukrainian government contractors in Latvia and Lithuania and a financial institution in Ukraine. ESET has called the malware, which renders computers inoperable by disabling rebooting, HermeticWiper. The NotPetya attack of 2017, which devastated Ukrainian businesses, was a wiper attack that encrypted computers irretrievably and spilled over into other countries, causing $10bn (£7.5bn) of damage worldwide. Alexi Drew, a senior analyst at RAND Europe, a research institute, said cyber offensives carried the risk of escalating rapidly if attacks spill over widely into other countries, although in the case of HermeticWiper the malware does not appear to be self-propogating, whereas NotPetya was able to spread. Further attacks, however, could be different, she added. “There’s a history of cyber-attacks not staying where they’re meant to go. If you look at NotPetya, the splash damage there was significant. There is a danger here of escalation because offensive cyber activity is fundamentally not very good at staying where you put it.” Priti Patel said officials were on alert for cyber-attacks and disinformation campaigns from Moscow. “As we monitor developments, we will be especially mindful of the potential for cyber-attacks and disinformation emanating from Russia,” the home secretary said. 03:37Why has Putin’s Russia waged war on Ukraine? – video explainer The chief executive of Lloyds Bank, Charlie Nunn, said on Thursday the lender was on “heightened alert … internally around our cyber risk controls, and we’ve been focused on this for quite a while”. Preparation for potential cyber-attacks was discussed in a meeting between the government and banking industry leaders on Wednesday, Nunn added. According to Symantec, the wiper attack that hit Ukraine this week had been planned for some time. One Ukrainian organisation suffered an initial hack in December last year that was related to the recent attack. DDoS attacks were also deployed ahead of the military offensive in order to spread confusion, according to the US cybersecurity firm Mandiant. In a DDoS attack, websites are deluged with vexatious requests for information and become unreachable. The targets on Wednesday included the Ukrainian defence ministry and PrivatBank, Ukraine’s largest commercial bank. “It’s not so much the technical disruption, it’s what it does to undermine confidence, like in the financial sector. It gets people quite nervous. It’s more that kind of secondary impact,” said Jamie Collier, a Mandiant consultant, who described a DDoS as akin to stuffing a thousand envelopes through a letterbox every second. However, Dr Lennart Maschmeyer at the Center for Security Studies at the Swiss university ETH Zurich, said Russia’s cyber strategy so far seemed more improvised. “A plausible scenario for more devastating cyber-attacks was that Russia had planned this invasion for a long time, and prepositioned implants across Ukraine’s critical infrastructure in order to cause mass disruptions coinciding with the military invasion. That does not seem to be the case. The cyber operations we have seen do not show long preparation, and instead look rather haphazard,” he said. The headline and text of this article were amended on 24 February and 3 March 2022 to make clear that this was a malware incident affecting machines, not a virus.",0

The harsh new sanctions target Russia’s largest banks and companies, effectively cutting them off from western financial markets, while imposing restrictions on the exports of advanced technology used to power the country’s military and tech sector.  “Putin is the aggressor. Putin chose this war,” the US president said. “And now he and his country will bear the consequences.” Part of a coordinated response, Biden said the measures taken by the US and allied nations around the world were meant to “maximize a long-term impact” on Russia, extracting severe costs on Moscow immediately and over time for what Biden called its “brutal assault” on a sovereign nation. Sanctions against Russia – at a glanceRead more Biden warned that Putin’s “desire for empire” extended beyond Ukraine, saying the Russian leader sought to re-create the former Soviet Union. The president was emphatic in his vow that US troops would not engage Russia in Ukraine, but he again affirmed the US would defend “every inch of Nato territory”. The commitment was underscored by an announcement that Biden had authorized the deployment of additional US troops to Germany as part of Nato’s response. As Biden addressed the nation from the East Room of the White House, the Ukrainian government reported mounting casualties as Russian troops unleashed a punishing offensive on the nation, advancing on the nation’s capital, Kyiv. Biden’s remarks came hours after he held a virtual meeting with the leaders of Britain, Canada, France, Italy and Japan. European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen, European Council president Charles Michel, and Nato secretary general Jens Stoltenberg were also in attendance. Earlier on Thursday, Biden convened a meeting of the US national security council. 01:21'Putin will bear the consequences’: Biden addresses Russia's invasion of Ukraine – video In the afternoon, Biden spent an hour on the phone with the Democratic and Republican leaders in Congress, briefing them on the situation in Ukraine and the administration’s response to date. The White House has been threatening severe sanctions for weeks, in hopes of deterring Putin from waging war on Ukraine. Earlier this week, when Putin made clear he intended to invade, the White House levied an initial “tranche” of sanctions in response. The penalties imposed on Thursday were designed to further destabilize Russia’s financial system while starving the country of technology critical to its economy and military, such as semiconductors. The US Treasury said the latest round of sanctions against Russia would affect nearly 80% of all banking assets in Russia, fundamentally threatening its economy and weakening the Kremlin’s geopolitical posture. “Treasury is taking serious and unprecedented action to deliver swift and severe consequences to the Kremlin and significantly impair their ability to use the Russian economy and financial system to further their malign activity,” said Janet Yellen, the Treasury secretary. Touting the unity among allies and partners, Biden said the sanctions would limit “Russia’s ability to do business in dollars, euros, pounds and yen to be part of the global economy”. But they are not as forceful as some elected officials in the US and Ukraine have called for, steps that would include removing Russia from the Swift international banking system and targeting Russia’s energy sector or leveling sanctions against Putin personally. “We demand the disconnection of Russia from Swift, the introduction of a no-fly zone over Ukraine and other effective steps to stop the aggressor,” Ukraine president Volodymyr Zelenskiy said in a tweet. On Thursday, congressman Adam Schiff, the chairman of the House intelligence committee, called on the US to “dramatically escalate” its response to Moscow and endorsed calls to remove Russia from the international banking system and its ability to access western capital. Biden argued that time was needed to allow the current round of sanctions to take their desired effect, and said the US was “prepared” to impose more severe penalties on Russia. The president defended his administration’s response. For several weeks, the US has declassified and made public Putin’s secret plans, while moving quickly to blame Russia for a series of cyber-attacks against Ukrainian banks and agencies. The purpose of the approach was to expose the Kremlin’s justification for war as baseless, he said. What is Swift and what would shutting Russia out of it achieve?Read more “Now, it’s unfolding largely as we predicted,” the president said. Asked by reporters whether he was consulting China to isolate Russia, Biden would not comment. He also said he was working to persuade India to join the western-led push against Russia. Biden said he had no plans to talk to Putin. During the White House briefing on Thursday, White House press secretary Jen Psaki downplayed the threat of a nuclear attack, after Putin warned that countries that interfered with Russia’s invasion would face “consequences you have never encountered in your history”. Some analysts interpreted Putin’s comments as a warning that he was prepared to use the country’s nuclear arsenal. “We don’t see any increased threat in that regard at the present time,” Psaki said. As thousands of Ukrainians flee the country, Psaki said the US was prepared to welcome Ukrainian refugees to the US, but expected that the vast majority of them would prefer to remain in Europe. She said the US was working to support humanitarian efforts in neighboring countries, where the European Union is preparing for a large number of displaced people. Psaki also said the US was “outraged” by “credible” reports that Russian soldiers were holding staff hostage at the Chernobyl nuclear site, near Kyiv. “This unlawful and dangerous hostage-taking, which could upend the routine civil service efforts required to maintain and protect the nuclear waste facilities, is obviously incredibly alarming and deeply concerning,” she said. “We condemn it and request their release.” The US president also urged resolve among the American people, who he said would probably face economic consequences as a result of what Biden called Putin’s “naked aggression”. The US has also warned government agencies and operators of critical infrastructure to take pre-emptive actions to safeguard against a possible Russian cyber-attack. In a stark contrast to Donald Trump, who has repeatedly assailed Biden during the escalating crisis while badly mangling the facts surrounding Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Barack Obama called on “every American, regardless of party” to support the president’s efforts to punish the Kremlin. Echoing Biden, Obama acknowledged that there would be economic consequences for Americans, but that it was a “price we should be willing to pay to take a stand on the side of freedom”. As Biden has warned throughout his presidency, he said democracies around the world were being tested and threatened by Putin’s “sinister vision for the future of our world”. He said there was never a question that the US would respond to Russia’s assault on Ukraine. “This aggression cannot go unanswered,” Biden said. “America stands up to bullies. We stand up for freedom. This is who we are.”",0

The continent awoke to the shock of scenes it once believed it had left in the 20th century: helicopters strafing homes outside the capital, long lines of tanks ploughing ever deeper towards Ukraine’s heartland, roads choked with refugees, and civilians huddled in underground stations to escape bombardment.  The west scrambled to respond with a range of new sanctions against Moscow, with the US also announcing it would send 7,000 more troops to Germany to shore up Nato’s eastern borders. But even after the invasion there were divisions on the strength of the response, as Russian forces advanced undeterred by the threats. 01:11Footage shows Russian helicopters engaging with forces in Ukraine – video With ferocious fighting on multiple fronts, Putin’s ultimate war aims were not entirely clear, but they appeared to be ambitious. Russian airborne forces descended on a military base at Hostomel, just outside Kyiv, with the possible objective of forcing open a pathway to the capital. US secretary of state, Antony Blinken said that “all evidence suggests that Russia intends to encircle and threaten Kyiv”. “We believe Moscow has developed plans to inflict widespread human rights abuses – and potentially worse – on the Ukrainian people,” Blinken told a meeting of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE). Russian troops were also clearly attempting to cut off Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second city, with a population of nearly 1.5 million, in the east. Russian attacks in Ukraine Ukrainian authorities said one Russian column had seized control of the Chernobyl nuclear plant, the site of Europe’s worst environmental disaster in 1986, and an emblem for many Ukrainians of the incompetent despotism of rule from Moscow. Mykhailo Podoliak, an adviser to the head of the president’s office in Kyiv, admitted it was “impossible to say” whether the site, where the remains of its radioactive reactor core lie buried, was safe. White House press secretary Jen Psaki said the US was “outraged” by credible reports that staff at the plant were being “held hostage” by Russian forces. “This unlawful and dangerous hostage-taking, which could upend the routine civil service efforts required to maintain and protect the nuclear waste facilities, is obviously incredibly alarming and gravely concerning. We condemn it and we request their release,” she said. The port city of Mariupol, which lies between the two regions of Ukraine already occupied by Russia, Crimea and the Donbas in the east, was also reported to be under heavy fire. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, declared martial law and pledged that his government would arm every Ukrainian willing to defend their country. In a late-night address, he said that 137 people had died in fighting, and claimed that Russia had named him “target number one.” As Ukrainian diplomats pleaded with the world to stop the Russian aggression, Zelenskiy warned of a bleak return to the past. “What we have heard today are not just missile blasts, fighting and the rumble of aircraft,” he said. “This is the sound of a new iron curtain, which has come down and is closing Russia off from the civilised world. Our national task is to make sure this curtain does not fall across our land.” Many of Putin’s keenest observers had thought the Russian leader would hesitate before ordering an all-out land war to subjugate Ukraine because of the potentially catastrophic consequences for Russia as well as Ukraine, but he proved them wrong. While Russia was chairing an emergency session of the UN security council that was tasked with finding a way out of the crisis the Kremlin had engineered, Putin broadcast a declaration of war he had recorded three days earlier, underlining the futility of the global diplomatic efforts to dissuade him. 03:37Why has Putin’s Russia waged war on Ukraine? – video explainer The US and Europe sought to inflict punitive measures on his regime with the aim of ensuring that Putin’s war of choice became his worst strategic blunder, by crippling the Russian economy. “Putin’s aggression against Ukraine will end up costing Russia dearly economically and strategically,” Joe Biden warned. “We will make sure of that. Putin will be a pariah on the international stage.” Biden said he was sending 7,000 more troops to strengthen Nato’s eastern borders, expelling Russian diplomats, imposing sanctions on Russia’s two largest banks and almost 90 financial institution subsidiaries around the world. Asked if the invasion marked the start of a new cold war, Biden replied: “That depends. It’s going to be a cold day for Russia.” At the same time, the UK announced its “largest ever” set of economic sanctions on Russia, freezing assets of all major Russian banks and limiting cash held by Russian nationals in UK banks and sanctioning more than 100 individuals and entities. However, clear divisions remained among western countries, with the US and European allies concerned about the global economic ramifications of some of the stronger sanctions. Biden admitted for example that exclusion from the Swift global electronic transactions system was not in the present package of sanctions. It was not, Biden said, the “position that the rest of Europe wishes to take”. Nor did the sanctions announced on Thursday include restrictions on Putin himself. The omission of Swift sanctions enraged the Kyiv government. The foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, said that those opposing the move had to “understand that the blood of innocent Ukrainian men, women and children will be on their hands too”. In announcing the sanctions on Thursday, Biden suggested that a wider conflict was possible, given Putin’s aspirations. “He has much larger ambitions than Ukraine. He wants to reestablish the former Soviet Union – that’s what this is about,” he said. Late on Thursday, French president Emmanuel Macron called Putin “to demand an immediate halt” to Moscow’s offensive, the Elysee Palace said. The Kremlin, meanwhile, said only that the two leaders had a “serious and frank exchange of views” about Ukraine. In his speeches, Putin has portrayed the Ukrainian government as a mortal threat to Russia, and hinted heavily at his desire for regime change. He claimed that the Kyiv government had ambitions and means to acquire nuclear weapons, and was run by Nazis – claims so outlandish that they triggered questions about the Russian leader’s mental stability. By mid-afternoon on Thursday, Russia’s defence ministry claimed to have “neutralised” Ukraine’s airbases and air defences, destroying 74 military ground facilities, including 11 airfields, three command posts and 18 radar stations for anti-aircraft missile systems. Ukrainian authorities said Russia had carried out 203 attacks and that fighting was raging across almost the entire territory. Military sources in Ukraine said 20 Russian helicopters and Mi-8 aircraft had landed paratroopers at Hostomel airport in the Kyiv region, where forces from both sides were fighting for control. They said Ukrainian forces had killed 50 Russian troops, destroyed four Russian tanks, and downed six Russian planes and four helicopters. Zelenskiy also said Ukrainian forces were fighting to prevent Russian troops capturing the former nuclear power plant at Chernobyl. The early hours of the invasion appeared to have claimed dozens of civilian lives in Ukraine. According to the authorities, 18 people were killed in a missile attack in the southern Odessa region, six people were killed in the town of Brovary, near Kyiv, and four people were killed and 10 injured after an “occupier’s shell” hit a hospital in the city of Vuhledar in Donetsk. Air raid sirens sounded in Ukraine’s major cities, and civilians in Kyiv and Kharkiv sheltered in the cities’s metro stations – scenes that have not been seen in those cities since 1941. Kuleba urged the world to wake up. “Putin has just launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine,” he said “Peaceful Ukrainian cities are under strikes. This is a war of aggression. Ukraine will defend itself and will win. The world can and must stop Putin. The time to act is now.”",0

The spy chief’s message – in part – was to warn his Kremlin counterparts that the West was concerned about unusual troop movements it was seeing near Ukraine’s border. ‘Putin chose this war,’ Biden says as he announces new sanctions against Russia – US politics liveRead more  British officials were anxious, too. “We keep on coming back to crises over Ukraine,” one said later that month. “President Biden does not send Bill Burns to Moscow unless he is very worried about something. And so, you know, without being able to go into the full details, there is enough substance to this to make us concerned.” A few days later, in early December, the Washington Post reported that US intelligence had found that the Kremlin was “planning a multi-front offensive as soon as early next year involving up to 175,000 troops”, from the north, east and south. 03:37Why has Putin’s Russia waged war on Ukraine? – video explainer The intelligence warnings continued into January, increasingly to the irritation of Kyiv, whose president Volodymyr Zelenskiy complained that acute tensions with Russia were nothing new. “We have been in the situation for eight years,” he said at the time, referring to the start of the 2014 war with Russian-backed separatists. At the time, some were considered outlandish. Britain warned that Russia was contemplating a coup plot, involving four exiled politicians, while the US said plans were afoot to create a pretext for an invasion using a “very graphic” fake video of a Ukrainian attack. It turned out that Russia did try to create false pretexts, but with none of the production values – or credibility – the US warning implied. The debacle of the buildup to the war in Iraq, where claims of weapons of mass destruction turned out to be baseless, has hung over US and UK agencies for two decades. This time, unfortunately, their warnings about Vladimir Putin’s intentions have proved uncannily accurate.",0

The Oscar-winning star and longtime humanitarian activist appeared at a press briefing by the Ukrainian government in Kyiv on Thursday, listening to government officials speak about the crisis many world leaders are calling the worst conflict in Europe since 1945.  Ukraine fighting to stop ‘a new iron curtain’ after Russian invasionRead more Penn previously visited Ukraine in November 2021 to research for the film. His visits with the Ukrainian military were documented by the Ukrainian joint forces operation press service, which posted photos of the meetups on social media at the time. According to Newsweek, Penn arrived in Kyiv earlier this week and met with deputy prime minister Iryna Vereshchuk, as well as local journalists and members of the military. The office of Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy issued a statement through the Ukrainian embassy in praise of the actor and director, who “specially came to Kyiv to record all the events that are currently happening in Ukraine and to tell the world the truth about Russia’s invasion of our country”. “Sean Penn is among those who support Ukraine in Ukraine today. Our country is grateful to him for such a show of courage and honesty,” the translated statement read. The statement also said Penn “is demonstrating bravery that many others have been lacking, in particular some Western politicians. The more people like that – true friends of Ukraine, who support the fight for freedom – the quicker we can stop this heinous invasion by Russia”. This is not the first time Penn has put himself in the center of a crisis. The 61-year-old actor directed the 2020 Discovery Plus documentary Citizen Penn, about the process of establishing his non-profit Community Organized Relief Effort, or Core, in the wake the devastating earthquakes in Haiti in 2010. Core also helped deploy teams for Covid-19 testing and vaccination during the pandemic. In January 2016, Penn published an exclusive – and highly controversial – interview with Mexican drug kingpin Joaquín “El Chapo” Guzmán in Rolling Stone; Penn’s covert journey to visit with the Sinaloan cartel leader, who escaped from prison in 2015, contributed to his arrest by Mexican authorities. Penn later said he had “terrible regret” that his interview and 10,000-word article did not achieve its true purpose of changing the conversation about the war on drugs.",0

I can only imagine what it’s like for people in Ukraine who are living with the shelling,” said Taras Kulish, a Toronto-based charity lawyer and member of the Ukrainian Canadian Congress. “We’re all concerned and there’s a definitely a shock factor in processing it.”  Announcing new sanctions on key Russian figures, Justin Trudeau on Thursday condemned the “horrific, unprovoked attack” on Ukraine. “We stand united and steadfast in our support of Ukraine’s sovereignty,” the prime minister said. “And we stand in solidarity with the Ukrainian people’s right to decide their own future in a free and democratic state.” Canada’s sanctions will target wealthy Russians, large banks and members of the Russian security council, including the defence minister, the finance minister and the justice minister. Canada will also halt export permits to the country. The deputy prime minister, Chrystia Freeland, who is of Ukrainian descent, said Russian president Vladimir Putin’s decision to invade Ukraine placed him in the ranks of the “reviled European dictators” who caused mass death and carnage in the 20th century. Airstrikes at dawn as Russia begins ‘war of aggression’ with UkraineRead more At times speaking in Ukrainian, Freedland also called on fellow members of the Ukranian Canadian community to show strength and to support loved ones affected by the war. “The Ukrainian people, like all people, must be free to determine their own future,” she said. “We know that the people of Ukraine … are fighting for us too. They are fighting for democracy and we stand with them.” Canada’s new sanctions comes after it previously pledged C$500m (US$780,770) in financial support Ukraine C$7.8m worth of lethal equipment and ammunition. For Ukrainian Canadians, news of the invasion has been devastating. A number of organizations across Canada are quickly raising funds for relief projects, organizing rallies and assisting those with families affected by the war. The prairie province of Alberta announced it would donate C$1m to the Ukrainian Canadian Congress, a recognition of the large diaspora population in the region– and the long history Ukrainian residents have farming the area. Kulish, who works closely with humanitarian organizations in Ukraine, says colleagues on the ground have described the surreal experience of shelling near their homes and the constant worry of loved ones. “I’ve been checking in with colleagues telling them we’re here. We’re praying for you. We’re looking to see what we can do in response. We’re trying to give them that knowledge that people are concerned about them and who love them,” said Kulish. “But you can’t imagine what it’s like. It’s almost unfathomable.” For the last eight years, Kulish has been involved in work providing trauma therapy clinic’s in the country’s eastern region. “We’ve been living this for the last seven years, so in one way, we’re terribly prepared for it.”",0

According to Ukrainian officials, the initial wave of strikes appeared to involve cruise missiles, artillery and airstrikes, which struck military infrastructure and border positions, including airbases.
Russian troops have entered the country from the north, east and south, seemingly targeting the capital, Kyiv and the cities of Kharkiv and Kherson respectively.
Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, responded to the invasion by declaring martial law and saying Kyiv would issue weapons to every Ukrainian who wanted to defend their country. As Ukrainian diplomats pleaded with the world to stop the Russian aggression, Zelenskiy warned of a bleak return to the past.
By mid-afternoon on Thursday, Russia’s defence ministry claimed to have “neutralised” Ukraine’s airbases and air defences, destroying 74 military ground facilities, including 11 airfields, three command posts and 18 radar stations for anti-aircraft missile systems.

Videos and photos on social media show lines of cars moving out of cities and heading west, as well as an increase of people on foot near the southern and western borders.
Joe Biden ordered broad new sanctions targeting four Russian banks, oligarchs and high-tech sectors. The US president also said 7,000 additional troops would be deployed to Germany. “Putin is the aggressor,” Biden said. “Putin chose this war, and now he and his country will bear the consequences.”
The UK’s prime minister, Boris Johnson, announced the “largest ever” set of economic sanctions on Russia, including pushing to end Russia’s use of the Swift international payment systems, freezing assets of all major Russian banks, limiting cash held by Russian nationals in UK banks, and sanctioning more than 100 individuals and entities.
Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, voiced his anger as EU heads of state and government appeared to hold back from imposing the potentially most damaging sanction on Russia.

15,"Thursday, 24 February 2022",2022-02-24,"Compared with Putin, Boris Johnson is a sociopath we can accept",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/feb/24/compared-with-putin-boris-johnson-is-a-sociopath-we-can-accept,,"The clues had all been there. The buildup of troops on the Ukrainian border. The increasingly bizarre, stage-managed television appearances of Vladimir Putin. The movement of troops into the self-proclaimed republics in Luhansk and Donetsk. Yet still there was a belief that diplomacy and reason could somehow win through and that Russia would pull back from all-out war. That hope died early on Thursday morning when Putin launched a ground, sea and air offensive on several Ukrainian cities, including the capital, Kyiv. Just after midday, Boris Johnson delivered his own televised statement from behind a small table hastily positioned in front of a doorway in Downing Street. Presumably his office was too much of a tip for him to be filmed there. There was an early reference to Neville Chamberlain, who in a 1938 radio address had described the dispute over the Sudetenland as “a quarrel in a faraway country between people of whom we know nothing”. Johnson stressed that Ukraine was neither far away nor a country of which we know nothing. But otherwise there was little of the Churchill tribute act that has characterised his recent Commons appearances.  Instead we got something more restrained. More hesitant, even. As if even he couldn’t quite believe it had come to this and was uncertain of what steps to take beyond a vague aspiration to defeat Putin. He talked the talk. Bodies – not ours – would mount up and Russia would be hit with massive sanctions. Yet there was a dissonance. A disconnection. It was almost as if he was aware that these were desperately serious times and he needed a different persona to his naturally glib self. Yet he couldn’t conjure one that was entirely convincing. Johnson did rather better when he faced the Commons to make a statement on Ukraine in the afternoon. Possibly because he had had a quick lesson in statesmanship from a crisis management expert, though more likely because he had accepted a few home truths. This was one of the few occasions when it didn’t matter that most of the country didn’t rate him at all and believed his first instinct was always to protect himself. In a straight fight with a delusional, narcissistic dictator who had just invaded another country and had blood on his hands, the UK’s very own narcissist was going to win hands down. Put simply, Putin was in a totally different league of sociopath. So Johnson only had to stand up to look good. It also helped that this time, Boris actually had something substantial to say. On Tuesday, he had talked a good line about Ukraine’s independence and democratic freedoms, only to come up with a list of sanctions that were about as effective as pissing in the wind: five small banks and three individuals who had already been sanctioned by the US back in 2018. At the time, the Suspect had tried to make out that this was part of a carefully gradated response, but he had clearly been taken aback when almost the entire house – the Lib Dems had been the most hawkish of the lot – thought the government was useless and it was only a matter of time before Putin invaded the rest of Ukraine. After he had recovered from nearly dying of laughter. Johnson wasn’t going to make the same mistake twice. So he followed up his tough words on Putin with equally tough sanctions. Dozens of companies and individuals would have their assets frozen – possibly even some that had donated to the Tory party, though that wasn’t made entirely clear. He also made it clear that the UK had been pushing the EU and other Nato countries to block Russia from the Swift international money transfer system – something the EU and the US were so far reluctant to do. Maybe if things got worse … The Suspect was for once ahead of the curve. He promised to bring forward the economic crime bill to next Monday, having promised it some time in the next session earlier in the week. He also hinted that the sanctions would hit UK citizens’ cost of living. For someone pathologically averse to telling people things they don’t want to hear, this was a huge step forward. Though not one necessarily to be repeated. Keir Starmer was also in his comfort zone, relishing the chance to show that Labour could be trusted in matters of defence and security. So much so that he had threatened to withdraw the whip from the 11 of his MPs unless they took their names off the Stop the War statement they had signed. He too condemned Putin and promised to back all the sanctions. And any others Johnson happened to want to bring in at a later date. You couldn’t put a cigarette paper between Starmer and Johnson, and much of the rest of the session developed into a love-in, with everyone falling over themselves to agree with one another in their determination to defeat Russia. Occasionally someone would seek clarification that people or businesses hadn’t been left off the sanction list, and the Suspect duly wrote down their names and added them to it. Even the most hawkish seemed to have decided that Nato being militarily involved was a bad idea. The defence secretary, Ben Wallace, just looked glum as he sat next to Johnson. Then maybe he was still kicking himself for making a twat of himself by telling the army that he would kick Russian backsides just like in the Crimean war. Anyone for the Charge of the Light Brigade? There were only two small moments of tension. Alba MP Neale Hanvey looked disappointed he didn’t get more applause for having persuaded his leader, Alex Salmond, not to broadcast on Russia Today. And Labour’s Clive Lewis had to be reminded that the time for negotiation was generally before an invasion, not after it. But otherwise it was all sweetness and light.

Main map  Hostomel airbase As of Thursday evening, a fierce battle for the strategic airbase close to Kyiv appeared to be continuing after Russian helicopters and airborne troops attempted to establish a bridgehead outside the city. Videos on social media – among the most dramatic to have emerged since the invasion began – depicted a swarm of Russian Ka-52 and Mi8 helicopters descending on the Antonov military airfield. Hostomel airbase Hostomel map Ukraine said it had downed three helicopters in the initial assault, but a lunchtime report from CNN showed Russian forces in control of at least some of the base. Shortly after, however, Ukraine’s armed forces chief said Kyiv’s forces were fighting back in a critical early battle. Justin Bronk​, of the Rusi thinktank, said if airborne assault troops could take and hold the airbase, the Russians could use it to rapidly build up forces ahead of heavy ground troops to put pressure on the capital. “However, it’s high risk because until ground forces link up, the airborne assault forces are deep in Ukrainian territory and dependent on aerial resupply, casualty evacuation and fire support,” he said. Chernobyl and the north A Ukrainian presidential adviser said Ukraine had lost control of the Chernobyl nuclear site in the north, where fighting raged after Russian troops crossed the border from Belarus. The adviser said authorities did not know the current condition of the facilities at the site of the world’s worst nuclear disaster. Ukraine’s interior ministry warned that if artillery fire was to hit waste stored after the 1986 disaster, it could lead to “radioactive nuclear dust” being spread “over the territory of Ukraine, Belarus and the countries of the EU”. The Chernobyl exclusion zone lies directly in the path of what western experts believe is the principal invasion route from Belarus to the west of Kyiv, where Ukraine’s presidential palace and key buildings are located. Russian troops also advanced from the north on the city of Chernihiv. One axis of advance appears to have centred around the Senkivka border crossing to the north-east of Chernihiv. Crucial, perhaps, in this calculation is the fact that south of Chernihiv – which lies to the east of the Dnieper river – lies the E95 highway to Kyiv. Russian military vehicles crossing at the Senkivka border crossing. Photograph: Ukraine border guard Kharkiv and the east A substantial attack appeared aimed towards the eastern city of Kharkiv, which has a population of more than 1 million. Multiple reports from Kharkiv described explosions nearby – while Ukraine’s defence ministry said mid-morning that “fierce fights” were taking place in that area. Kharkiv Andriy Zagorodnyuk, Ukraine’s former defence minister, said Russian forces were trying to surround Kharkiv. “It seems like Kharkiv at the moment is the main target,” he said. Kherson and the south Russian forces heading north into Ukraine from Crimea were not meeting any obvious resistance, at least initially. Border guards released security camera footage on Thursday showing a line of Russian military vehicles crossing into Ukraine’s government-held territory from Russian-annexed Crimea. Crimea border footage Kherson map Social media footage appeared to show Russian forces reaching the city of Kherson on the Dnieper, 80 miles (130km) inside Ukraine. Shortly after, around lunchtime, the presidential adviser said fierce fighting was taking place there. Film posted online was said to show Russian helicopters over the nearby Kakhovka hydroelectric power plant. Russian forces had also moved north-eastwards from Crimea to Melitopol, where the presidential adviser said they would meet resistance. Zagorodnyuk said: “They are quite close to the city of Kherson now. The situation is really critical there.” Missile strikes Air and missile strikes appear so far to be mostly focused on military targets, including an air defence site in the frontier down of Mariupol, the Ukrainian naval base in Ochakiv and an arms depot in Kalynivka, 124 miles (200km) south-west of Kyiv, according to the defence intelligence specialists Rochan Consulting.

Photograph: Evgeniy Maloletka/AP Russia’s defence ministry said its forces had destroyed 74 “objects of above-ground military infrastructure”, though this could not be confirmed. The US said it believed Russia launched 100 missiles and used 75 aircraft in the first wave of bombing. Casualties Information on casualties has been hard to verify, though on Thursday evening Ukraine’s health minister said 57 people had been killed and 169 injured. Ukraine’s armed forces earlier reported that at least 40 soldiers had died. The Ukrainian presidential adviser said up to 10 civilians had been killed. The mayor of Mariupol said three civilians had been killed there and emergency services in Kharkiv said a boy had been killed after shelling struck an apartment building. The local administration in Odesa said 22 people had died in a strike on a military base. How the militaries compare Russia has amassed more than 150,000 combat troops on the borders of Ukraine, with a further 34,000 lightly armed separatist forces in the pro-Russian self-proclaimed republics in Donetsk and Luhansk. That amounts to an estimated two-thirds of Russia’s total ground forces. Half of Moscow’s air force is also deployed in the region. Ukraine’s forces are considerably smaller. It has a regular army that numbers 125,600, according to the International Institute for Strategic Studies, but has mobilised reserves of at least 36,000. how the armies compare Some of the Russian ambition has been aimed explicitly at demoralising Ukrainian civilians with the reach of the offensive. While much of the initial barrage was aimed at the east of Ukraine, so far, more sporadic strikes on cities in the west, from Uman to Lutsk and Ivano-Frankivsk, seem designed to demonstrate the reach of Russian weapons.",0

Pointing to sharp declines in Russian stock markets and the value of the rouble since the invasion of Ukraine, Johnson said, “we will continue on a remorseless mission to squeeze Russia from the global economy piece by piece, day by day and week by week.” He had earlier tried and failed to convince fellow G7 leaders to shut Russia out of the Swift global payments system, though his spokesperson said he would continue to press the issue in the coming days. Johnson announced 10 measures the UK was taking immediately. The assets of all major Russian banks in the UK will be frozen, including VTB, the country’s second largest bank with assets totalling £154bn. 01:11Footage shows Russian helicopters engaging with forces in Ukraine – video Individual sanctions will be imposed on over 120 individuals, entities and subsidiaries, including Rostec, the country’s biggest defence company, which exports £10bn in arms a year, as well as four other defence companies. Legislation is expected be tabled next week to ban major Russian companies from raising finance on UK markets and to prevent Moscow from raising sovereign debt in London. Oligarchs who will be sanctioned include Putin’s former son-in-law Kirill Shamalov, Russia’s youngest billionaire; Denis Bortnikov, the deputy chair of VTB Bank’s management board; and Yury Slyusar, the director of the United Aircraft Corporation. The Russian airline Aeroflot will be banned from landing in the UK. A diplomatic source said: “These are people who have international lifestyles. They come to Harrods to shop, they stay in our best hotels when they like, they send their children to our best public schools, and that is what’s being stopped.“So that these people are essentially persona non grata in every major western European capital in the world. That really bites.” Quick GuideWhat is Swift?ShowWhat is it?Swift (the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication) is the main secure messaging system banks use to make rapid and secure cross-border payments, allowing international trade to flow smoothly. It has become the principal mechanism for financing international trade. In 2020, about 38m transactions were sent each day over the Swift platform, facilitating trillions of dollars worth of deals.Who owns it?Swift, founded in the 1970s, is a co-operative of thousands of member institutions that use the service. Based in Belgium, it remains neutral in trade disputes, being run principally as a service to its members.Why would a Swift ban be so serious?Boris Johnson told MPs it would harm the Russian economy if it was locked out of Swift. Run of the mill transactions would need to be conducted directly between banks, or routed through fledgling rival systems, adding to costs and creating delays.Why is the US reluctant to effect a ban?One reason is that the impact on Russian businesses might not be so serious. The head of a large Russian bank, VTB, said recently he could use other channels for payments, such as phones, messaging apps or email. Russian banks could also route payments via countries which have not imposed sanctions, such as China, which has set up its own payments system to rival Swift. A ban on Russia using Swift could accelerate a the use of China’s rival Cips system. There is also a fear that it could damage to the US dollar’s status as the global reserve currency, and accelerate the use of alternatives such as cryptocurrencies.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback. The UK will suspend and prohibit all dual-use export licences to Russia, which covers items that could have civilian or military use. There will also be legislation to prohibit a wide range of hi-tech exports to Russia, including semiconductors, aircraft parts such as Rolls Royce jet engines, and oil refinery equipment. Number 10 said it would set out more detail in the coming days about new legislation to limit the deposits that all Russian nationals can hold in UK bank accounts to £50,000, intended to choke off the ability of Russians to raise finance and keep their money in London. The measures will also apply to Belarus, which Russian forces have used to invade Ukraine. The government will also bring forward the economic crime bill, before Easter recess, aimed at making assets more transparent. Labour leader Keir Starmer said his party would support the measures, saying the public would face “economic pain,” as a result, but “the British public have always been willing to make sacrifice to defend democracy on our continent and we will again”. 0Boris Johnson promises ‘massive package of sanctions’ after Russian invasion of Ukraine – video Johnson had faced criticism from across the political spectrum earlier this week for introducing sanctions that many MPs, including in his own party, felt were too weak. Responding to Johnson’s statement on Thursday, former prime minister Theresa May said “every possible economic sanction” should be levied on Russia so it “absolutely feels the cold wind of isolation” and understood it had become a “pariah state”. Jeremy Hunt, the former Tory foreign secretary, said economic sanctions would not go far enough and that a “fundamental review of our military capability” was needed, as well as a revisiting of the “out of date” Integrated review of the UK’s defence policy. Some Conservative MPs called for the UK to increase military aid to Ukraine, including the former cabinet minister David Davis, who said the UK should consider providing air support to the Ukrainian armed forces. Davis said that even the most “ferocious sanctions … are no longer a deterrent, they are a punishment” and that the invasion of Ukraine meant Vladimir Putin had “effectively declared war on the west”. Full list of planned sanctions 1. An asset freeze on all major Russian banks, including VTB, the country’s second largest bank, which has assets of £154bn. 2. Legislation will be introduced to parliament on Tuesday that will prohibit the ability of all major Russian companies to raise finance on UK markets, and for the Russian state raise sovereign debt on UK markets. The aim is to pass the legislation in one day. 3. A set of individual sanctions on over 100 individuals, entities and subsidiaries, when also counting the measures unveiled on Tuesday. The new targets include the Russian state-owned defence giant Rostec, its subsidiaries, and a group of oligarchs seen as particularly close to the Kremlin. These are: Kirill Shamalov: Russia’s youngest billionaire and Vladimir Putin’s former son-in-law. Petr Fradkov: head of Promsvyazbank, one of the banks sanctioned, and the son of the former head of Russia’s FSB intelligence service. Denis Bortnikov: deputy president and chair of VTB bank. Yury Slyusar: head of Russia’s United Aircraft Corporation. Elena Georgieva: board chair of Novikombank. More people will be named in the weeks to come. The individuals will be banned from all UK transactions – meaning those with children in UK private schools will be unable to pay future fees. Relatives will not, however, be sanctioned personally. 4. Immediately ban the ability of Russian airline Aeroflot to land in the UK. 5. An immediate suspension of all dual-use export licences to Russia. This covers items that could have a civilian or military use, such as electrical components and truck parts. 6. In the coming days, legislation to prohibit a wide range of hi-tech exports, and the export of equipment connected to extracting oil and gas. This is being done in concert with the US. UK accused of being ‘toothless’ in sanctions enforcementRead more 7. Looking into a way to limit the amount of deposits Russian nationals can hold in UK bank accounts. The details have to be decided, and also whether this will cover dual nationals. 8. A plan to work with allies to shut off Russia’s access to the Swift international banking system. This would have a major impact, but can only be done effectively if other countries agree. 9. Extending the full range of sanctions to Belarus, given the integration of the nations’ military forces. 10. The UK’s economic crime bill, which will strengthen areas such as unexplained wealth orders, will be brought forward. On Wednesday Boris Johnson had told MPs the bill would not be brought to the Commons this parliamentary session.",0

But by evening, thousands of people in cities across Russia had defied police threats to take to central squares and protest against the military campaign. Police had made at least 1,702 arrest in 53 Russian cities as of Thursday evening, according to the OVD-Info monitor, as they cracked down on the unsanctioned protests. Most of the arrests were made in Moscow and St Petersburg, where the crowds were largest.  The protesters chanted: “No to war!” as they exchanged shocked reactions to the attack on Ukraine. A man holding a placard reading “No war” shouts slogans during a protest at Pushkinskaya Square on February 24, 2022 in Moscow, Russia. Photograph: Konstantin Zavrazhin/Getty Images In Moscow, Alexander Belov said he thought that Putin had “lost his mind”. “I thought that we would never see a war like this in the 21st century,” said Belov, who arrived early at Moscow’s Pushkinskaya Square to find it surrounded by police vans. “It turns out we live in the Middle Ages.” The mood in Moscow was dark and sombre hours after Putin had announced that he was launching a broad military offensive targeting Ukraine. “I am embarrassed for my country. To be honest with you, I am speechless. War is always scary. We don’t want this,” said Nikita Golubev, a 30-year-old teacher. “Why are we doing this?” His anger and hopelessness were shared by many commuting to work down central Arbat Street. At the Ukrainian culture centre just down the road, the mood was even grimmer. The Ukrainian administrator said the centre, which aims to promote the language, traditions and identity of a country Vladimir Putin denied the legitimacy of as a modern state in his speech on Monday, would be shut for the “coming period”. 01:56Russia has invaded Ukraine: what we know so far – video report “We are being bombed as we speak. Of course we are closed! Jesus, what is happening?” the administrator, who did not want to give his name, shouted. There were already signs that Russians were uncomfortable with Putin’s initial decision to recognise the two self-proclaimed republics in Donbas. On Tuesday, Yuri Dudt, one of Russia’s most popular media personalities, said he “did not vote for this regime” and its need for an empire, and felt ashamed, in a post that received almost a million likes in 24 hours. A fresh poll by the independent Levada Center released on Thursday showed that only 45% of Russians stood in favour of the recognition move that preceded Thursday morning’s dramatic events. “I didn’t think Putin would be willing to go all the way. How can we bomb Ukraine? Our countries have their disagreements, but this is not a way to solve them,” said Muscovite Ksenia. A man holds a placard reading “No war. Putin, go away” during a protest at Pushkinskaya Square. Photograph: Konstantin Zavrazhin/Getty Images But outcries of anger were not only felt on the streets of Moscow, where the Guardian did not encounter support for the military assault. Russia’s cultural and sporting elite, usually firmly behind Putin and often called upon by the president during election campaigns to gather popular support, also expressed their deep worries about Russia’s invasion. Valery Meladze, arguable the country’s most beloved singer, posted an emotional video in which he “begged” Russia to stop the war. “Today something happened that should have never happened. History will be the judge of these events. But today, I beg you, please stop the war.” Likewise, Russian football international Fyodor Smolov posted on his Instagram channel: “No to War!!!” Police officers detain a protester in Nizhny Novgorod. Photograph: Roman Yarovitsyn/AP US intelligence has for months warned that Russia would seek to fabricate a major pretext before launching an invasion of Ukraine. In the end, no major false flag came, and experts now believe that Putin decided to act without gathering the backing of his own electorate. “Putin seems totally indifferent to approval on the street. He’s acting not like a politician in need of public support, but like a figure from national history books who cares only about the approval of future historians and readers,” tweeted Alexander Baunov, a political analyst at the Carnegie Moscow Center. The Russian leader looked to have also surprised some of Russia’s most prominent oligarchs, who saw their wealth tumble as the country’s financial markets collapsed. Just on Monday, after Putin recognised the independence of the two Donbas territories, Oleg Deripaska, a Kremlin-friendly oligarch who once said that “he does not separate himself from the Russian state”, exclaimed on his Telegram channel that “war had been averted”. He has since deleted the post. War in Ukraine: where has Russia attacked?Read more On Russian state television, the invasion was framed as a defensive mission aimed at preserving Russian lives. “What’s the point of a major first strike? However strange or cynical it sounds, it’s actually humane because it allows everyone around to prevent a large massacre. By immobilising Ukraine, life is being preserved,” said pundit Vladislav Shurygin on the Channel One programme Vremya Pokazhet. Police officers near the monument to Marshal Georgy Zhukov on Manezhnaya Square. Photograph: Kommersant Photo Agency/REX/Shutterstock Some risked arrest on Thursday evening in order to voice their opposition to the invasion. Zhargal Rinchinov from Buryatia arrived on the square in a jacket with the inscription: “No to war.” If he held up a sign, he said, he would be arrested. “Everyone is scared,” he said. “They know if they say something bad then they’ll be put in jail. So people pretend they don’t notice we have started a war, so they don’t have to speak up about it.” For Ukrainians, public messages of opposition to the war will come too late. The country has said that at least 40 soldiers have already been killed and many more civilians injured, as it is threatened with being overrun by a much larger military force. Yet, sensing that a genuine large-scale pushback against war might be Ukraine’s best bet, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, Ukraine’s president, on Thursday morning urged Russians to speak up. “If the Russian authorities don’t want to sit down with us to discuss peace, maybe they will sit down with you.” 03:37Why has Putin’s Russia waged war on Ukraine? – video explainer",0
21,"Thursday, 24 February 2022",2022-02-24,Airstrikes at dawn as Russia begins ‘war of aggression’ with Ukraine,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/24/airstrikes-dawn-russia-begins-war-aggression-with-ukraine-vladimir-putin,,"It began an hour before dawn, airstrikes and missiles raining down on military bases, airfields, border posts and cities across Ukraine, explosions lighting up the still-darkened sky from Odessa to Mariupol, Kharkiv to Dnipro, Lutsk to the capital, Kyiv. In the grey early light that followed, Russian tanks and troops began rolling across the border, columns of soldiers pouring into the eastern regions of Chernihiv, Kharkiv and Luhansk. Others landed in the ports of Odessa and Mariupol.  In Moscow, shortly before 5am, Vladimir Putin had announced the launch of the biggest attack by one state against another in Europe since the second world war. “I have decided,” he said, “to conduct a special military operation.” The assault, the Russian president said, was aimed at “the demilitarisation and denazification of Ukraine”, and any foreign country that tried to interfere risked “consequences you have never seen”. 00:43Russia-Ukraine crisis: Putin orders military operation in Ukraine – video Barely an hour later, at 5.58am in Kyiv, as explosions rattled the city and sirens blared, Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, tweeted: “Putin has just launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Peaceful Ukrainian cities are under strikes.” This was “a war of aggression”, Kuleba said. “Ukraine will defend itself and will win. The world can and must stop Putin. The time to act is now.” Minutes afterwards the country’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, addressed his nation in a tense video, saying explosions were now being heard “in many cities across the country”. He declared martial law. On the overnight train from the south-eastern port city of Mariupol to the capital – the last, perhaps, to make the journey for some time – passengers woke up to news from the now besieged city they had left behind. There was an air of grim calm; no shouting or weeping, no explosions of emotion. People flicked through their phones, watched snatches of video showing shelling; held long, subdued conversations with those now stuck behind the frontline and wondering what they should do next. The south and east were not the only regions of Ukraine under attack; reports soon began coming in of an armoured incursion, backed by Belarusian troops, through the Senkivka border crossing in the north, as well as of Russian armour moving into Ukraine from Crimea. Ukraine invasion By 7am, two hours into the assault, Russian-backed separatist rebels were launching multiple attacks on Ukrainian military positions around the self-proclaimed republics in Luhansk and Donetsk in the south-east. Video footage showed Russian rockets hitting populated areas in major cities, despite Moscow’s claims that it was only targeting military infrastructure; pictures from Kharkiv showed the tail section of an unexploded rocket sticking out of the pavement close to an Orthodox church. Russia has amassed more than 150,000 combat troops on the borders of Ukraine, with another 34,000 lightly armed separatist forces in the self-proclaimed republics: an estimated two-thirds of the country’s total ground forces. Half its air force is also deployed in the region. As Europe awoke, leaders denounced the assault, warning of heavy casualties and a huge economic impact. Financial markets opened – and instantly plunged. Oil prices soared. Governments convened emergency meetings and readied new sanctions.

Photograph: Aris Messinis/AFP/Getty In Kyiv, a city of three million people, the city’s mayor, Vitaly Klitschko, urged residents to stay at home unless they were involved in critical work and to prepare go-bags with necessities and documents in case they needed to evacuate. Some headed underground, seeking refuge in the metro. With reports suggesting Russian tanks were advancing on Kyiv from Belarus, barely 93 miles (150km) and two and a half hours’ drive and away, others hurriedly packed suitcases and took to trains, cars and buses; main roads leading out of the city started to back up from mid-morning. “We are facing a war, and horror. What could be worse?” said one resident, Liudmila Gireyeva, 64. She said she was planning to travel later in the day to the western city of Lviv, and then to try to move on to Poland to join her daughter. Putin “will be damned by history”, Gireyeva said. “Ukrainians are damning him.” As the train from Mariupol pulled into Kyiv, only an hour late, at 11am, those on board tumbled out into a city reeling from the start of hostilities few believed would reach such a terrifying scale. The station was crammed with people desperate to get on a train out – in almost any direction but eastwards. People take shelter in a metro station in Kyiv after Russian forces invaded Ukraine. Photograph: Viacheslav Ratynskyi/Reuters “My parents called me around 5am to say war is coming and I didn’t believe them,” said Anna Bolosheva, 27, taking a train to stay with relatives in a rural area to the north of Kyiv. “I opened the news and there wasn’t much about it – but then I heard the explosions. I couldn’t imagine it, and I can’t understand it. Yesterday I didn’t think this could happen.” Eight hours’ drive and 340 miles (550km) to the west, in the city of Lviv, near the Polish border, the queues for banks and pharmacies and supermarkets were already snaking round the block. 01:46'I don't want to leave': Ukrainians record messages from their cars as they flee war – video Lviv had long seemed one of Ukraine’s safer cities, prompting several western embassies concerned about a possible Russian invasion to relocate there from Kyiv, but morning air raid sirens and news of Russian strikes in Lutsk to the north and Ivano-Frankivsk to the south had punctured that illusion. Glued to his phone was Ivan Taibov, 27, from Odessa. His screen showed video of a plume of smoke rising from his home city. “They’re calling for people to come to its defence,” he said. “I’m trying to see if it is possible to get back. There will be a fight.” Tanya Hrunyk, a 43-year-old economist waiting in one of the bank queues, was wondering whether to stay in Lviv and for how long. “I have family in the country where I could go. I’ll go if there’s an evacuation. Until then, I’m not sure,” she said. Asked what she thought of Putin’s reasons for attacking her country, Hrunyk said sharply: “He’s a crazy man. He’s mentally ill. Our task is to stay calm and united.” Ivan Borislavsky, a bartender who is expecting a baby with his partner in a month, said he was staying. “I need to fight for my wife and children and my land,” he said. Ukrainian officials confirmed video footage from several sources of a Russian helicopter assault at Hostomel, barely four miles from Kyiv. At least 20 Mi-8 and Ka-52 helicopters flew in from Belarus to attack an airfield that is home to the Antonov aircraft maker and has a runway long enough to handle big cargo planes. 01:11Footage shows Russian helicopters engaging with forces in Ukraine – video By lunchtime, casualties were starting to mount: 18 dead in a missile attack near Odessa, according to authorities; six more in Brovary, half an hour’s drive north-east of Kyiv. In Vuhledar, near Donetsk, an occupier’s shell hit the hospital, killing four people and injuring 10, including six doctors. Russia’s military claimed to have wiped out Ukraine’s air defences; Ukraine’s to have shot down five Russian aircraft and killed 50 soldiers on the eastern front. In Mariupol, in the far south-east, close to Russian-occupied territory, Yulia, a local journalist, said she had heard multiple heavy explosions on the opposite side of the city from the western Primorsky district where she was with her young son. “We’ve collected our stuff and are ready to run to a bomb shelter if necessary,” she said. But she added she was worried because she could not reach her mother, who lives in the eastern part of the city, by phone. “I hope it’s just because her phone battery has run out,” she said.

Photograph: Anadolu Agency/Getty Images In Kherson, east of Odessa, Svitlana described a column of Russian tanks, APCs, military trucks and rocket launchers moving inexorably north in the direction of Nova Kakhovka. “We are just sitting in our houses,” she said. “The shops are closed, nothing is working.” There was shelling earlier, but now it was quiet. Nearly 560 miles away in Moscow, banks and exchange bureaux opened for business but rapidly ran out of dollars as the Russian rouble plunged to an all-time low. Despite a barrage of state media propaganda, many residents expressed profound shock that Russia should have launched a full-scale attack on its neighbour. “I didn’t think Putin would be willing to go all the way. How can we bomb Ukraine? We have our disagreements, but this is not to a way to solve them,” said one appalled Muscovite, Ksenia Fadeeva. Another, Nikita Golubev, said: “I am embarrassed for my country. To be honest with you, I am speechless. War is always scary. We don’t want this.” Tatyana, who asked for her surname not to be published, said she “couldn’t believe the news I read this morning. A war with Ukraine? What are we doing? I feel powerless.” Smoke rises from an air defence base in the aftermath of an apparent Russian strike in Mariupol. Photograph: Evgeniy Maloletka/AP Ordinary citizens were not alone. Valery Meladze, arguably Russia’s most popular singer, posted an emotional video in which begged Russia to stop the war. “Today something happened that should have never happened. History will be the judge of these events. But today, I beg you, please stop the war,” he said. By 2pm, Andriy Zagorodnyuk, a former Ukrainian defence minister, was describing a situation that was still “extremely tense. There are thrusts happening. They are quite close to Kherson; the situation is critical there. They are trying to surround Kharkiv. Ukrainian armed forces are fighting quite seriously. There is no panic.” Shortly after, Ukraine called on the EU to urgently provide air defence and anti-missile systems, as well as use “all means” to jam Russian satellite signals, requesting an “end to business as usual” with Russia and “fierce measures against Belarus, which directly supported Russia’s full-scale invasion”. Russia’s defence ministry, meanwhile, claimed about 12 hours into the attack to have destroyed 74 Ukrainian military ground facilities, including 11 airfields, three command posts and 18 radar stations for anti-aircraft missile systems. Women use their phone as they wait with bags and suitcases near Kyiv-Pasazhyrskyi railway station in Kyiv. Photograph: Daniel Leal/AFP/Getty Back in Kyiv, the capital’s central railway station, Kyiv-Pasazhyrskyi, was crowded with hundreds of passengers seeking to leave. There were long queues for tickets and information. Several trains had been cancelled, marked red on the departure board, but others were functioning as normal. By 6pm, there were still huge queues of cars trying to escape the capital and head westward, with the main road out jammed with vehicles. Drivers stood next to their vehicles, patiently waiting for the route to clear. Mayor Klitschko ordered a 10pm-7am curfew but said metro stations would stay open all night for shelter. As darkness began to draw in at the end of the first day of what analysts have said may prove Europe’s fiercest conflict for more than 75 years, Zelenskiy turned to an earlier dark era, and a celebrated phrase from the end of that war. “What we have heard today are not just missile blasts, fighting and the rumble of aircraft,” the Ukrainian president warned. “This is the sound of a new iron curtain, which has come down and is closing Russia off from the civilised world. Our national task is to make sure this curtain does not fall across our land.”",0
22,"Thursday, 24 February 2022",2022-02-24,Labour MPs drop backing for statement criticising Nato after Starmer warning,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/feb/24/labour-mps-drop-backing-for-statement-criticising-nato-after-starmer-warning,,"A group of 11 Labour MPs from the left of the party have removed their names from a statement about the invasion of Ukraine, which heavily criticises Nato after being warned they risked losing the party whip. In a rapid victory for Keir Starmer over MPs still linked to Jeremy Corbyn, the Labour chief whip wrote to the 11 backbenchers asking them to remove their signatures from a statement drawn up by the Stop the War group.  It is understood that Alan Campbell told the group, including Diane Abbott, John McDonnell and Richard Burgon, that they risked losing the Labour whip if they did not remove their names. A party spokesperson later said all the MPs had agreed to do so. The Stop the War statement, which accuses the UK government of “sabre-rattling” over Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, also criticises it for saying Ukraine has a right to join Nato if it wishes. It says the alliance “should call a halt to its eastward expansion and commit to a new security deal for Europe which meets the needs of all states and peoples,” adding: “We refute the idea that Nato is a defensive alliance, and believe its record in Afghanistan, Yugoslavia and Libya over the last generation, not to mention the US-British attack on Iraq, clearly proves otherwise.” While Corbyn is a long-term Nato sceptic, Starmer has stressed his support for the organisation. Writing in the Guardian earlier this month, the Labour leader said the party’s commitment to Nato “is unshakable”. He was also heavily critical of Stop the War, which first emerged before the 2003 invasion of Iraq by US and UK forces, and which Corbyn chaired before becoming Labour leader. The group did not represent “benign voices for peace”, Starmer said, adding: “At best they are naive, at worst they actively give succour to authoritarian leaders who directly threaten democracies. There is nothing progressive in showing solidarity with the aggressor when our allies need our solidarity and – crucially – our practical assistance now more than ever.” A Labour spokesperson said: “The small number of Labour MPs that signed the Stop The War statement have all now withdrawn their names. This shows Labour is under new management. With Keir Starmer’s leadership there will never be any confusion about whose side Labour is on – Britain, Nato, freedom and democracy – and every Labour MP now understands that.” The other MPs who signed the Stop the War statement were Tahir Ali, Apsana Begum, Ian Lavery, Ian Mearns, Bell Ribeiro-Addy, Zarah Sultana, Mick Whitley and Beth Winter. Other signatories included Corbyn, who is sitting as an independent after losing the Labour whip for refusing to rescind comments he made in the aftermath of the publication of the Equality and Human Rights Commission report on Labour’s handling of antisemitism complaints. It was also signed by Claudia Webbe, the Leicester East MP who was elected for Labour but sits as an independent after being found guilty of a campaign of harassment, including threatening an acid attack, against a woman. Andrew Scattergood, co-chairman of left-wing campaign group Momentum, said: “These MPs’ steadfast commitment to the Ukrainian people and against Russia’s invasion is beyond question. Indeed, many of them have led the criticism of Putin’s act of aggression today, forcefully and without reservation. “It beggars belief that the Labour leadership instead focuses on a week-old statement in an attempt to wage factional warfare against them, while a real war wages on against the Ukrainian people.”",0
23,"Thursday, 24 February 2022",2022-02-24,Thousands of Ukrainians flee country after Russian invasion,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/24/ukraine-russia-flee-country-invasion,,"Thousands of Ukrainians have left the country and as many as 100,000 are internally displaced after fleeing their homes following the attack ordered by Vladimir Putin, the UN refugee agency has said. Videos and photos on social media show lines of cars moving out of cities and heading west, as well as an increase of people on foot near the southern and western borders.  The United Nations refugee agency said on Thursday that the situation was quickly deteriorating after Russia’s invasion, estimating that several thousand had already fled with more expected to follow. It appealed to neighbouring countries to keep their borders open to people seeking a safe haven. “We have already seen reports of casualties and people starting to flee their homes to seek safety,” said Filippo Grandi, the UN high commissioner for refugees. At the Luzhanka border crossing with Hungary in western Ukraine, hundreds of cars waited in a queue snaking more than 2 kilometres back from the border on Thursday afternoon. People said they had been waiting over six hours in line to cross. A steady stream of people crossed on foot, carrying suitcases and holdalls stuffed with belongings. Many were Ukrainians from the Hungarian minority that live in the west of the country, and said they were traveling to stay with relatives for a few days in the hope the danger would pass. Others had come from other parts of Ukraine and planned to drive on to Western Europe. “The people who have money are leaving,” said one of the customs officials at the post. He said over 1,500 people had left through the crossing by 4pm on Thursday, as opposed to just a few hundred on a normal day. One 19-year-old man from the town of Svyalava said he had left both because he was scared of Russian assault and of potentially being called up to the Ukrainian army. “My brother lives in Hungary and I’ll stay with him as long as it takes,” he said, waiting at the border post.

For weeks, central European countries on Ukraine’s western border have been making preparations for a potential influx of millions of refugees. Authorities in the countries next to Ukraine have already identified border crossings through which people can leave the country by land, such as Vyšné Nemecké in Slovakia, Záhony in Hungary, Siret in Romania, and Palanca in Moldova. Maia Sandu, the president of Moldova, said on Thursday there was an increase in traffic flow on the border. Poland is preparing a train, with medical equipment, to transport wounded civilians from the Ukrainian border to Polish hospitals, said the country’s health minister. “We are preparing a sanitary train with full rescue service and medical equipment to transport the injured,” said Adam Niedzielski. “This solution was created completely from scratch and, so far, has not been used in Poland. At the same time, we already have a list of 120 hospitals throughout the country to which victims may go. In total, we estimate at the moment that it would be possible to admit several thousand patients.” Poland, in particular, has been preparing for various scenarios, including a wave of up to a million people fleeing Ukraine, said Maciej Wąsik, the deputy interior minister. Poland is already home to about 2 million Ukrainians, many of whom moved after the 2014 conflict, and they have taken advantage of a relatively easy scheme to gain work permits. The government has said it is planning to house Ukrainian refugees in hostels, dormitories and sports facilities. A reception point for refugees from Ukraine established in Dorohusk, Poland.

The ground floor of the exhibition centre in the south-eastern Polish city of Rzeszów has been equipped to receive people who may flee Ukraine, about 30 miles to the east. War in Ukraine: where has Russia attacked?Read more Germany has said it will offer support to countries in eastern and central Europe, especially Poland, facing an influx of refugees. German media have cited estimates that between 200,000 and a million people may flee to the EU from Ukraine in the event of a war. “We will offer massive support to the affected states – especially our neighbour Poland – in the event of large refugee movements,” the interior minister, Nancy Faeser, said in a statement, adding she had been in touch with the Polish government and the European Commission. Franziska Giffey, the mayor of Berlin, told news outlet RBB 24 that the German capital was preparing for the arrival of refugees. “For next week, we have set ourselves the goal of discussing concrete implications, what preparations we can make, especially in the event of people fleeing this situation,” Giffey said. Other countries in Europe have offered support to countries in eastern Europe in case of a wave of refugees leaving Ukraine. António Costa, the prime minister of Portugal, said potential refugees from Ukraine were welcome in the Iberian country, home to a large Ukrainian community. “Ukrainian citizens who have family, friends and acquaintances here are welcome in Portugal,” Costa said, promising to facilitate the issuance of entry visas.",0

The invasion launched in the early hours is illegal, immoral and outrageous. It is, above all, a catastrophe for Ukraine: a massive assault by an aggressor with a well-documented ruthlessness and disdain for civilian lives. But as the country’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, warned: “The fate of not only our state is being decided, but also what Europe will be like.” A country that endured so many 20th-century traumas is now experiencing the continent’s biggest attack by one state on another since the second world war.  The unprovoked assault does not merely destroy the hopes of 1991. It is also a terrible blow to the broader international system. Vladimir Putin launched this attack even as the UN security council made its last desperate attempts to stave it off, and as the secretary general, António Guterres, pleaded with him publicly to call off his troops. It is true that the rules which prevailed after 1945 have been honoured perhaps as often in the breach as the observance. But the Russian president has spelt out his utter contempt for the teetering rules-based international order at its very heart. Russia claimed for months that it would not invade; its assurances that it will not occupy Ukraine are worth nothing. Even on its own supposed logic, the request for military help from the breakaway “republics” in the east cannot explain why troops are advancing from the north and south, and bombarding targets across the country. Mr Putin says that he wants to “demilitarise” and “de-nazify” a democratic country that freely chose its Jewish president. Kyiv believes his aim is to topple the government and install a puppet regime. How far the Russian president goes may be determined in large part by the Ukrainian response, and the costs its military can inflict. Mr Putin warned against other countries “meddling”, with the chilling warning that otherwise there would be “consequences you have never encountered in your history” – a barely coded nuclear threat – though Ukraine has long known it will fight alone, albeit strengthened by the recent influx of arms and advice. A brave minority in Russia have publicly decried this war. Even allowing for his work to insulate his country – amassing foreign currency, reducing western imports and increasing links with China and others – it is likely to pay for this assault with a weakened economy, increasing isolation, a reinvigorated Nato and a bitterly anti-Russian Ukraine. Though state media is pumping out propaganda, and internet censors threatened others with fines if they used non-official sources in their reporting, Mr Putin has done strikingly little to prepare the public for the invasion, or its costs. Yet a president who has twinned aggression abroad with repression at home seems indifferent not only to those costs, but also to the public response to them. Ukrainians now need and deserve the staunchest support. Those who flee must be given a true welcome by western Europe as well as neighbouring countries. But the big question is what price Ukraine’s backers are willing to pay. The UK and EU promised “massive” sanctions, but hours after the invasion, states were still bickering over how far to go. A further hike in energy prices could tip countries into rampant inflation and potentially recession, with the danger of political destabilisation and further division as citizens struggle to get by. Mr Putin has reason to believe that he can weather the reaction. Nord Stream 2 is now on hold; yet its construction began just one year after Russia annexed Crimea. Ukraine’s friends must make clear that this time is different, with a sustained as well as large-scale response. Serious attempts to counter Moscow’s aggression must start now, but will be the work of years. It will take years, too, to understand the new era on which we are all now embarking.",0
26,"Thursday, 24 February 2022",2022-02-24,The Guardian view on Britain and Ukraine: play our part,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/feb/24/the-guardian-view-on-britain-and-ukraine-play-our-part,,"Boris Johnson was quickly out of the blocks when the news arrived from Ukraine before dawn. By 5am, a tweet was out in his name condemning Russia’s military invasion and promising a decisive response. He spent the morning getting briefed and on the phone to other leaders, including President Volodymyr Zelenskiy in Kyiv. At midday he broadcast to the nation, and in the early afternoon he took part in a virtual G7 meeting to coordinate sanctions against Russia with the US, the EU, Japan and Canada. By 5pm, he was spelling out the UK’s new plans in the House of Commons. Mr Johnson is a prime minister on probation with his own party. His initial announcement of sanctions against a handful of Russian banks and oligarchs had been scorned, including by Tories, as underwhelming.  So Thursday night’s new package went further, as it should have done even without Russia’s assault. Although the G7 failed to agree to exclude Russia from the Swift international banking system, the package they agreed is substantial. Mr Johnson announced new curbs covering banks, exports, the freezing of assets and a ban on the Russian airline Aeroflot. Whether this will “hobble the Russian economy”, as Mr Johnson promised in his broadcast, remains to be seen. But the exercise shows the incomparable value of working together with allies. These were the easier bits. Warm words are Mr Johnson’s comfort zone. But the invasion of Ukraine is not a verbal joust. It is a violent and dangerous fact. It will not be reversed by sonorous phrases. To do that requires serious planning, deliverable agreements, effective deeds, the building of trust with allies, and sustaining the effort over a long period, if necessary at some financial and human cost. This is the bit where Mr Johnson always falls down. Nevertheless, these leadership qualities are essential in the dangerous new world that Russia created this week. This is, as Keir Starmer said, a turning point. Mr Johnson talked some of the talk in his broadcast, with references to “our European continent”, about Ukrainian “neighbours and co-workers”, and about responding “in concert with our allies”. He was quite right. But is he capable of turning words into consistent realities? To do so will demand a major change in approach from the government and the prime minister. In particular, it will mean working hard, consistently and reliably with the EU and allied European governments on big issues like defence, intelligence, energy, sanctions and the treatment of refugees. It will require an end to smug claims to be world-leading, to threats to break treaty commitments, and to public digs at neighbours and allies. It is a tall order. Dangerous times demand it all the same. There were hints of a new approach on Thursday. But Mr Johnson remains very much on probation.",0

Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, voiced his anger shortly before EU heads of state and government decided against blocking Russia from an international payments system through which it receives foreign currency.  With casualties mounting, Kuleba warned that European and US politicians would have “blood on their hands” if they failed to impose the heaviest toll on Moscow by cutting Russia from the Swift payments system. “I will not be diplomatic on this,” he tweeted. “Everyone who now doubts whether Russia should be banned from Swift has to understand that the blood of innocent Ukrainian men, women and children will be on their hands too. BAN RUSSIA FROM SWIFT.” With Russian military forces seemingly ready to storm Kyiv, Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy had a “frank” message for EU leaders as he joined their summit via video on Thursday evening. Appealing for the harshest measures against the Kremlin, he told them that he may not be able to speak to them again given the military situation. Later Zelenskiy claimed that Russian assassins were in the Ukrainian capital and that both he and his family were on a kill list. Quick GuideWhat is Swift?ShowWhat is it?Swift (the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication) is the main secure messaging system banks use to make rapid and secure cross-border payments, allowing international trade to flow smoothly. It has become the principal mechanism for financing international trade. In 2020, about 38m transactions were sent each day over the Swift platform, facilitating trillions of dollars worth of deals.Who owns it?Swift, founded in the 1970s, is a co-operative of thousands of member institutions that use the service. Based in Belgium, it remains neutral in trade disputes, being run principally as a service to its members.Why would a Swift ban be so serious?Boris Johnson told MPs it would harm the Russian economy if it was locked out of Swift. Run of the mill transactions would need to be conducted directly between banks, or routed through fledgling rival systems, adding to costs and creating delays.Why is the US reluctant to effect a ban?One reason is that the impact on Russian businesses might not be so serious. The head of a large Russian bank, VTB, said recently he could use other channels for payments, such as phones, messaging apps or email. Russian banks could also route payments via countries which have not imposed sanctions, such as China, which has set up its own payments system to rival Swift. A ban on Russia using Swift could accelerate a the use of China’s rival Cips system. There is also a fear that it could damage to the US dollar’s status as the global reserve currency, and accelerate the use of alternatives such as cryptocurrencies.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback. The Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (Swift) is used by over 11,000 financial institutions to send secure payment orders and is key to the movement of funds to Russia’s oil and gas sector. Removing Russia from the system, it is argued, would make it close to impossible for financial institutions to send money in or out of the country, with consequences for both the country’s oil and gas sector and its European customers. A number of member states believe there is nothing to be gained from waiting, a position shared by the UK government. Mark Rutte, the Dutch prime minister, admitted that “many colleagues pleaded for it” but he told reporters that “more work needs to be done to assess what happens if Russia is cut off”. During a call with the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, the British prime minister, Boris Johnson, had urged allies to react with the harshest measures, warning that “western inaction or underreaction would have unthinkable consequences”. UK sources said Johnson had also made a major play for leaders to withdraw Russia’s access to Swift during his G7 speech to other world leaders. Canada’s Justin Trudeau was the only other leader to express support for finding a way to enforce the ban. “On Swift, I think we all recognise that it is something that has to be done in conjunction with our major allies and will only be successful if that can be achieved as such, we are continuing those discussions,” Johnson’s spokesman said. “There are a range of views on it and we recognise it is a challenge. But it is certainly the prime minister’s intention so we will continue to have those discussions.” The Irish taoiseach Micheál Martin said his government also supported “the strongest possible sanctions”. Lithuania’s president Gitanas Nausėda, said the EU needed to learn the lessons that the bloc’s previous sanctions had been “too weak”. “We cannot have the luxury of being a discussion club,” he said. “Discussions are useful but we cannot forever be in discussions ... They need our support today, tomorrow might be too late.” Russia’s war on Ukraine explained: a complete visual guideRead more Poland’s prime minister Mateusz Morawiecki said that the EU had to be united around severe sanctions “on Putin, on Russia” if Europe was to be relevant around the world. “This is now a critical moment for the history of the European union, the history of Europe,” he said. “The whole free world is looking at us, at what kind of sanctions, what kind of reactions” Diplomatic sources suggested that Germany, Cyprus and Italy were among the member states who were the most concerned about taking the measure at this stage, arguing that some leverage needs to be maintained. “Someone started a war and we want this war to stop here and now,” one EU diplomat explained of the caution over Swift. “You always need to have some doors open to be able to have a dialogue to stop a war.” The diplomat added that the measures that did have unanimous support within the EU would “be much more effective with high cost and consequences than doing one single issue on Swift, which might be needed for things which are very relevant for some EU member states.” Later, Scholz confirmed that he was opposed to cutting Russia off from the international payments system. He said: “It is very important that we agree those measures that have been prepared, and keep everything else for a situation where it may be necessary to go beyond that.” The fissure in the united front with Ukraine came at what was seen by many as one of the most testing summits for a generation, with the bloc’s capacity to strike convincingly at Russian interests in question. 03:37Why has Putin’s Russia waged war on Ukraine? – video explainer In the early hours of Friday morning, at the end of the summit, European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, said the EU had agreed on measures that would degrade Russian industry, push its economy into recession and block exports of irreplaceable components. She said: “This package includes financial sanctions that cut Russia’s access to the most important capital markets. We are now targeting 70% of the Russian banking market, but also key state-owned companies, including the field of defence. “These sanctions will increase Russia’s borrowing costs, raise inflation and gradually erode Russia’s industrial base. We are also targeting the Russian elite by curbing their deposits so that they cannot hide their money anymore in safe havens in Europe.” Von der Leyen said an export ban on components for Russia’s oil sector would make it “impossible for Russia to upgrade its oil refineries, which gave actually Russia export revenues of €24bn in 2019”. “The third topic”, she said, “is that we ban the sale of all aircrafts, spare parts and equipment to Russian airlines. This will degrade the key sector of Russia’s economy and the country’s connectivity. Three quarters of Russia’s current commercial air fleet were built in the European Union, the US and Canada. And therefore, they are massively depending on that.” Finally, Von der Leyen said the EU would be “limiting Russia’s access to crucial technology … such as semiconductors or cutting-edge technologies.” Belarus will also be subject to a sanctions package that has yet to be prepared for its role aiding Russia’s invasion from its territory. But a consensus on the need for a major package of sanctions across the financial and energy sectors was marred by a lack of support for what many regard as the most damaging of actions, both for Moscow and European countries with the closest trading ties to Russia. Those opposed - dubbed the “incrementals” – were said to be pushing to hold back from imposing the most onerous measures. Officials suggested that Swift may be held back as part of a “third tranche” of sanctions. It is argued by some diplomats in Brussels that Russia could find ways around being blocked from Swift and that the other measures would be just as significant in squeezing the Kremlin.",0
29,"Thursday, 24 February 2022",2022-02-24,UK accused of being ‘toothless’ in sanctions enforcement,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/feb/24/uk-sanctions-enforcement-toothless-russia-deterrent,,"The UK government has been criticised for its “toothless” use of the sanctions regime, as campaigners raised concerns that the enforcement body set up in 2016 to patrol breaches has only ever issued only six fines worth a combined £21m. As the government announces a fresh wave of sanctions against Russia after the invasion of Ukraine on Thursday, opposition politicians and campaigners warned that the UK’s failure to take action against existing suspected breaches of sanctions “undermines any real deterrent value that UK sanctions could have”.  The Office of Financial Sanctions Implementation (OFSI), set up in 2016 by then chancellor George Osborne to act as a “centre of excellence for financial sanctions”, handed down just one fine in the year to the end of March 2021 despite investigating 132 suspected breaches. George Osborne set up the Office of Financial Sanctions Implementation in 2016. Photograph: Reuters By comparison, the US authorities issued 87 fines worth more than $1.5bn (£1.1bn) in the past five years. Susan Hawley, executive director of campaign group Spotlight on Corruption, said: “The OFSI’s very low enforcement rate and the very low average fine level make OFSI look pretty toothless, and undermine any real deterrent value that UK sanctions could have. “The OFSI lacks the kind of aggressive and proactive attitude to enforcement that would make the UK’s financial, accounting and legal sectors really sit up and take sanctions breaches seriously.” She warned that the lack of any criminal enforcement action over sanction breaches raises “real questions as to whether UK sanctions are actually be enforced properly at all”. Hawley highlighted the UK’s failure to act when a private jet targeted by sanctions against Alexander Lukashenko, Belarus’s autocratic leader and ally of Putin, landed at Luton airport earlier this year. The 13-seater Embraer Legacy jet was one of six aircraft listed by then foreign secretary Dominic Raab last year in sanctions aimed at Lukashenko. The lack of enforcement action by the OFSI comes despite its latest annual report showing that the total value of sanction breaches reported to the department in the year to March 2020 was £982m. That was a near fourfold increase on the value of reported breaches a year earlier. Hawley said the OFSI’s track record appeared shockingly weak compared with the US’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), which has issued 87 fines worth a combined $1.53bn between 2017 and 2022. David Lammy, the shadow foreign secretary, said the government must urgently explain why the OFSI had issued so few fines. He said the figures “show how government incompetence is contributing to the steady stream of dirty money from Russia and other authoritarian regimes flooding into the City of London”. A No 10 spokesperson said: “We certainly expect the sanctions to be met and we have done a lot of work with the Treasury in ensuring there is an impact. We want these sanctions to have an impact and will listen to views about how we do this.” An HM Treasury spokesperson said: “We are committed to ensuring business and individuals comply with financial sanctions, and to taking firm action when they don’t. Through our Office of Financial Sanctions Implementation we work to promote compliance in the first instance, and take compliance action against all reported suspected breaches. This article was amended on 4 March 2022. An earlier version said the US’s OFAC “has issued 87 fines worth a combined $1.53bn since 2021”. In fact the time period in which those fines were issued was between 2017 and 2022.",0

Minutes after the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, ended weeks of agonised speculation by announcing a “special military operation” at dawn on Thursday, explosions were heard near major Ukrainian cities, including the capital, Kyiv.  Ukraine’s interior ministry reported that the country was under attack from cruise and ballistic missiles, with Russia appearing to target infrastructure near major cities including Kyiv, Kharkiv, Mariupol and Dnipro. Zelenskiy responded to the invasion by declaring martial law and saying Kyiv would issue weapons to every Ukrainian who wanted to defend their country. As Ukrainian diplomats pleaded with the world to stop the Russian aggression, Zelenskiy warned of a bleak return to the past. “What we have heard today are not just missile blasts, fighting and the rumble of aircraft,” he said. “This is the sound of a new iron curtain, which has come down and is closing Russia off from the civilised world. Our national task is to make sure this curtain does not fall across our land.” By mid-afternoon on Thursday, Russia’s defence ministry claimed to have “neutralised” Ukraine’s airbases and air defences, destroying 74 military ground facilities, including 11 airfields, three command posts and 18 radar stations for anti-aircraft missile systems. Ukrainian authorities said Russia had carried out 203 attacks and that fighting was raging across almost the entire territory. Military sources in Ukraine said 20 Russian helicopters and Mi-8 aircraft had landed paratroopers at Hostomel airport in the Kyiv region, where forces from both sides were fighting for control. They said Ukrainian forces had killed 50 Russian troops, destroyed four Russian tanks, and downed six Russian planes and four helicopters. Zelenskiy also said Ukrainian forces were fighting to prevent Russian troops capturing Chernobyl. It was later reported that the Russians now held the former nuclear plant. The early hours of the invasion appeared to have claimed dozens of civilian lives in Ukraine. According to the authorities, 18 people were killed in a missile attack in the southern Odesa region, six people were killed in the town of Brovary, near Kyiv, and four people were killed and 10 injured after an “occupier’s shell” hit a hospital in the city of Vuhledar in Donetsk. Map With air raid sirens sounding over the capital and residents of Kharkiv sheltered in the city’s metro – scenes not seen in those cities since 1941 – Ukraine’s foreign minister also urged the world to wake up. “Putin has just launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine,” said Dmytro Kuleba. “Peaceful Ukrainian cities are under strikes. This is a war of aggression. Ukraine will defend itself and will win. The world can and must stop Putin. The time to act is now.” Andriy Zagorodnyuk, Ukraine’s former defence minister, told the Guardian that multiple ground invasions were taking place on several fronts. “There are thrusts taking place,” said Zagorodnyuk. “They are quite close to the city of Kherson now. The situation is really critical there. They are also trying to surround Kharkiv. It seems like Kharkiv at the moment is the main target. They also try to get to Kyiv using one battlefield group.” In a bid to justify the attack, Putin claimed in his TV address: “A hostile anti-Russia is being created on our historic lands.” 00:43Russia-Ukraine crisis: Putin orders military operation in Ukraine – video “We have taken the decision to conduct a special military operation,” he said, in what amounted to a declaration of war. He claimed it was for the “demilitarisation and denazification” of Ukraine, echoing a theme of Kremlin propaganda, the false claim that the Kyiv government is controlled by the far right. “We do not intend to occupy Ukraine,” he said, and he had a chilling warning for other nations. “To anyone who would consider interfering from the outside: if you do, you will face consequences greater than any you have faced in history. All relevant decisions have been taken. I hope you hear me,” he said. As Putin’s words were being broadcast and the first detonations were being reported, the UN security council was holding an emergency session, chaired by Russia itself, which holds the rotating presidency. It was begun by the UN secretary general, António Guterres, who made a direct appeal: “President Putin, stop your troops from attacking Ukraine. Give peace a chance. Too many people have already died.” Russia-Ukraine crisis live news: Putin has launched ‘full-scale invasion’, says Ukrainian foreign minister – latest updatesRead more The US president, Joe Biden, issued a written statement saying: “The prayers of the entire world are with the people of Ukraine tonight as they suffer an unprovoked and unjustified attack by Russian military forces. “President Putin has chosen a premeditated war that will bring a catastrophic loss of life and human suffering,” Biden said. “Russia alone is responsible for the death and destruction this attack will bring, and the United States and its allies and partners will respond in a united and decisive way. The world will hold Russia accountable.” 01:11Footage shows Russian helicopters engaging with forces in Ukraine – video Other world leaders also condemned the invasion. The UK prime minister, Boris Johnson said: “I am appalled by the horrific events in Ukraine and I have spoken to President Zelenskiy to discuss next steps. President Putin has chosen a path of bloodshed and destruction by launching this unprovoked attack on Ukraine. The UK and our allies will respond decisively. “We will hold the Kremlin accountable,” wrote Ursula von der Leyen, the head of the EU Commission, which had announced fresh sanctions against Moscow only hours before the attack. The stage for the offensive was set on Wednesday night, after the leaders of the two Russian-controlled territories in eastern Ukraine sent an official request to Moscow for military aid to “help repel the aggression of the Ukrainian armed forces in order to avoid civilian casualties and a humanitarian catastrophe in the Donbas”. Zelenskiy used a video address to appeal to the Russian public for help after an attempt to speak to Putin was unsuccessful. “Do Russians want wars? I would very much like to answer this question. But the answer is up to you,” he said. He also vowed to defend the country, saying: “If someone attempts to take away our land, our freedom, our lives, the lives of our children, we will defend ourselves. By attacking, you will see our faces, not our backs, but our faces.” Military analysts said they expected Putin to send his forces to capture or surround Kyiv. There were reports in Russian state media that airborne troops had captured the airport in Boryspil, near the capital. The Russian military claimed that all of Ukraine’s aviation bases were disabled in the barrage of missiles that began the invasion. 01:46'I don't want to leave': Ukrainians record messages from their cars as they flee war – video Smoke rose from near major airfields outside Kharkiv and other cities in the east. But Russia also appeared to have hit airfields in Kherson and as far west as Ivano-Frankivsk, which is nearer to the border with Poland. It indicated its forces had entered Ukraine, claiming Ukraine’s border forces were “not putting up any resistance to Russian units”. Some of the first explosions after Putin announced the operation were heard near Kramatorsk, the headquarters of the Ukrainian army’s operations near the Russian-controlled territories in south-east Ukraine. Russia appeared to be targeting military infrastructure in its early strikes on Thursday morning. Explosions were also reported at military headquarters, and at military warehouses. The dramatic escalation of the crisis is the second time Moscow has launched a significant military incursion into Ukraine since the country gained independence from the Soviet Union in 1991. In 2014, Putin ordered undercover Russian soldiers to seize the Crimean peninsula, which Moscow then annexed. Thursday’s attack was preceded by a massive, continuous cyber-attack that targeted Ukraine’s ministries and banks, a form of hybrid warfare to sow confusion. In previous weeks, Putin built up an estimated 190,000 troops close to Ukraine’s borders while European leaders shuttled between Kyiv and Moscow, seeking a diplomatic solution. The Russian military claimed it was not targeting population centres. “High-precision weapons are disabling the military infrastructure, air defence facilities, military airfields and aviation of the Ukrainian army,” the Russian defence ministry said in a statement carried by RIA Novosti, a state-run news agency. Military analysts questioned whether Russia could sustain the bombardment and believed a ground invasion was likely. “Russia has a very effective aerial, naval and ground fires capability but it lacks large stockpiles of precision-guided munitions, which is why a ground offensive appears to have begun soon after the first strikes. Russia has every incentive to move as fast as possible,” wrote Rob Lee, a senior fellow in the Foreign Policy Research Institute’s Eurasia Program. The Russian rouble fell to a record-low level since 2016 as Putin announced the military operation. Trading was halted on the Russian stock market. The US is likely to announce new sanctions against Russia, using tools to punish Russian banks and its larger financial system that Washington had so far held in reserve. Biden said: “I will meet with my G7 counterparts in the morning and then speak to the American people to announce the further consequences the United States and our allies and partners will impose on Russia for this needless act of aggression against Ukraine and global peace and security.”",0

In a scramble to prevent the invasion of Ukraine pushing Russia’s financial system into meltdown, officials in Moscow closed the stock exchange while the Bank of Russia mounted a rescue operation to put a floor under the skidding rouble.  By midday, the stock market had reopened and the rouble recovered to trade at 84 to the dollar, though late in the day it climbed back to 87 and analysts said an escalation of the war could force the central bank to intervene further to prevent the currency sinking even lower. “To stabilise the situation on the financial market, the Bank of Russia decided to start interventions on the currency market,” the central bank said. Russia’s main stock exchange fell 30% after reopening, falling from 3,000 to 2,000 points, while the MSCI index of shares in Russian companies traded in London and New York dropped by 45%. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Russia had created a financial safety net to withstand market volatility and said the “emotional” reaction of the financial markets to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine would even out. He added that all necessary measures were being taken to ensure the market reaction was as brief as possible. After weeks of denying plans to attack Ukraine, Russian forces fired missiles at several Ukrainian cities and landed troops on its coast, prompting analysts to predict that severe pressure on global financial markets was likely to persist over the coming weeks. Russia’s currency, bonds and stocks all sank before its central bank announced its first foreign exchange intervention to shore up financial stability since 2014, when the country annexed Crimea from Ukraine. Russia holds a formidable war chest of more than $600bn (£450bn) in foreign-exchange reserves and gold that it can use in currency markets to prop up the rouble. A rapidly depreciating currency makes it harder to pay off foreign debts and leads to higher prices on imported goods and lower returns on exports. Officials at the Bank of Russia are understood to have sold foreign reserves to buy roubles to put a floor under the price, though the extent of the buying operation is not yet clear. One of the biggest falls in the value of the rouble was against the euro. Before the recent round of geopolitical tensions between Moscow and the west began to escalate in October, the rouble was trading at around 80 to the euro. It is now heading towards 90. Susannah Streeter, senior investment and markets analyst at stockbroker Hargreaves Lansdown, said: “Market volatility has increased since the beginning of the year, stoked by rising interest rates, and today’s news has added fuel to the market turbulence.” As the US said it may cut off Russia’s top banks from dollar transactions if Moscow moves its troops into Ukraine, data showed in December that Russian banks brought $5bn in foreign exchange back to Moscow and moved some of their long-term foreign exchange holdings into more liquid assets if needed in an emergency. To support Russian commercial banks under pressure from falling share prices and western sanctions, the central bank increased the daily amount of roubles it would swap for dollars from $3bn to $5bn. This will allow commercial banks to replenish the dollar stocks needed to repay foreign debts. The Bank of Russia also expanded the list of securities it accepts as collateral in exchange for the liquidity it provides. Markets are now bracing for the impact of fresh harsh western sanctions to punish Moscow for the invasion of Ukraine. “The sanctions hit is going to be significant, unlike the soft sanctions imposed on Tuesday and Wednesday,” said the investment firm Renaissance Capital. The effective interest rate on Russian government debt soared to almost 10% as bond investors sold heavily to seek safer havens, although the effect is expected to be limited as most of the debt is held by domestic financial institutions. Ukraine’s government debt collapsed in value, pushing the country towards a further bailout by the International Monetary Fund. Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk The Washington-based lender of last resort said this week it was poised to start a virtual mission to Ukraine with a view to releasing $700m in aid. Since 2014, the IMF has committed more than $20bn in loans to Ukraine in a series of bailouts, though in 2019 it demanded that Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s government show it would aggressively try to recoup an estimated $15bn that was stolen from more than 100 banks, including the country’s largest, PrivatBank, over the previous decade before a further $4bn was released. The Russian central bank is expected to ease pressure on the rouble further by increasing its main interest rate, which it hopes will lure back foreign investors searching for high returns. The bank is also expected to continue monetary tightening by raising interest rates as it struggles to rein in inflation, which is set to worsen from the falling rouble.",0

33,"Thursday, 24 February 2022",2022-02-24,Putin’s attack on Ukraine isn’t just about Europe. We must rally the world against this act of war,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/feb/24/sanctions-defeat-putin-authoritarian-ideology-russia-ukraine,,"Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine is an unprovoked outrage and a heinous violation of international law. It is proof of his utter disregard for the health and wealth of the people of Russia and Ukraine. He is a tyrant prepared to take lives, destroy infrastructure and rob his own citizens in the name of a demented imperialist dream. The economic sanctions that the UK, its allies and partners enforce must be as severe as possible. The aim should be to cut Russia out of the western economic system, targeting the finance, energy, technology and defence sectors as well as individuals linked to Putin and the Russian government. The effects should be deep and long-lasting. This confrontation will last for years into the future. And here at home, after years of stubborn inaction, the government must now finally expunge corrupt Russian money from the UK. We must close the cracks and loopholes through which the tentacles of corrupt finance reach into our economy and democracy.  While sanctions are essential, we know that Putin’s concerns go far beyond the depth of his pockets, as shown by his willingness to act despite western threats of economic pain. Russia has been preparing for sanctions for at least two years. So, to defeat Russian aggression, we need to do more than attack Putin’s bank balance. While sanctions must be as comprehensive as possible, we need a broader response to face down his aggression. To defeat Putin, we need to unite against the ideology of Putinism. This is an ideology of authoritarianism, imperialism and ethno-nationalism. It is not unique to Russia. This ideology is emulated by despots and dictators around the world: leaders in China, the Middle East and beyond will be watching the strength of the west’s response to this invasion as they plot their next moves. Russia’s attack will have long-term implications for the security of Europe. If Putin is successful in the short term, the new frontline to Russian aggression will widen to include Poland, Romania, Slovakia and Hungary, as well as Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. We must work with our Nato and European allies and partners to bolster our continent’s defence and security and show strength, unity and resolve. But the opposition to Putinism needs to be broader than the G7, the EU or Nato. We need to rally the world against this threat and widen the international coalition that will oppose this grievous act of war, and counter Putin’s ideology of nationalistic expansion. We need to ensure that other global players such as India oppose the terrible precedent set by Putin’s invasion of a sovereign UN member state and his attempt to change national borders through military force. Can anyone in Russia stop Putin now? | Angus RoxburghRead more We must be clear that our opposition is to Putin and his gangster regime, not ordinary Russian people. Many of them will be feeling deeply uneasy as Russian troops wade across their nearest neighbour’s border, the home of many of their family and friends. Internal opposition to Putin’s deranged expansionism is the best hope of ending it. It’s imperative that we speak directly to them, making the argument for democracy, freedom and the right to self-determination, and never allowing our opposition to Putin to obscure our desire for friendship and peace with Russian people. It’s essential that we convince aspiring despots around the world that the Russian regime’s slide into imperialism is a historic mistake. Any victory will be pyrrhic in the long term, just as the invasion of Hungary in 1956, Czechoslovakia in 1968 and Afghanistan in 1979 all turned out to be failures in the end. The result of invasion is always brutal destruction, with civilians caught in the middle paying a terrible price. It is a moral imperative that we continue to help Ukraine to defend itself by providing defensive equipment alongside political, diplomatic and financial support. The Russian regime’s invasion of Ukraine signals the end of the post-cold war era. Nobody knows what comes next. The effects of this moment will depend as much on our response to this aggression as it will on the aggression itself. The response of the UK, its allies and its partners has to be strong not weak, united not divided, and strategic rather than short term. Our values of democracy and freedom must defeat Putinism in the end. David Lammy is the Labour MP for Tottenham and shadow foreign secretary

Vettel insisted he would boycott the meeting set for September if it was held while F1’s leaders prepared to hold a swiftly-convened summit on Thursday evening to discuss whether the race should go ahead. The German, a director of the Grand Prix Drivers’ Association, has long been outspoken on issues of social and human rights and was unequivocal in his condemnation of Russia’s invasion and in his conviction that he would not race there.  Uefa set to strip Russia of Champions League final at emergency meetingRead more “My own opinion is I should not go, I will not go,” he said. “I think it’s wrong to race in that country. I’m sorry for the people, innocent people who are losing their lives, getting killed for stupid reasons under a very strange and mad leadership. “I woke up again after this morning’s news, shocked. I think it’s horrible to see what is happening.” The Red Bull team principal, Christian Horner, was also emphatic that he believed F1 could not hold a race in Russia. “I can’t see how we can go possibly to Russia in the current climate,” he said. “It’s an issue for the governing body and the commercial rights holder that are responsible but how much can things change between now and September?” His position was echoed by his driver and current world champion, Max Verstappen. “When a country is at war, it is not right to race there,” he said. McLaren’s Lando Norris confirmed that the GPDA would discuss the issue at their next meeting The Russian GP at the Sochi Autodrom remains on the calendar, however, with neither F1 nor the sport’s governing body, the FIA, acting to cancel the meeting which is backed by the Russian government. A statement from F1 on Thursday morning noted only that the sport was monitoring the situation. “Formula 1 is closely watching the very fluid developments like many others and at this time has no further comment on the race scheduled for September. We will continue to monitor the situation very closely,” it read. The FIA has yet to issue any comment on the race in Russia but, with testing in Barcelona taking place this week, the team principals, F1 and the FIA have convened a meeting to discuss how the sport should react. Uefa is set to drop St Petersburg as the venue for this season’s Champions League final. Mick Schumacher drives his Haas during testing at Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya on Thursday. The team is sponsored by Russian chemical company Uralkali. Photograph: Peter J Fox/Getty Images Seven of the 10 teams are based in the UK and the British government’s position on holding sporting events in Russia is already clear. There are issues also for the Haas team, whose title sponsor is the Russian chemical company Uralkali. It is owned by Dmitry Mazepin, the father of their driver, Nikita Mazepin, and their car’s livery is marked by the white, blue and red design of the Russian flag. The team announced on Thursday it was to drop the Russian-flag based livery for the final day of testing and run in plain white colours. Michael Schumacher’s son Mick is entering his second season in F1 with Haas but how further sanctions imposed on Russia impact on the team are being considered. Haas later issued a statement saying: “No further comment will be made at this time regarding team partner agreements.” They withdrew their team principal, Guenther Steiner, from a scheduled press conference on Thursday in Barcelona. Haas also cancelled their post-testing media call with Mazepin at short notice. In 2014, the year the first Russian GP was set to be held, there were calls for it to be cancelled after the Russian annexation of the Crimean peninsula. The former world rally champion and a candidate for the FIA presidency Ari Vatanen was outspoken in his condemnation of the event. “Do we support the regime who is masterminding this bloodshed? Or do we say this is not correct?” he said. “It would send a message of acceptance if we went to Russia. It would say we condone, effectively, maybe not explicitly, but by our actions we condone what is going on because it is used in propaganda.” Vatanen said he was supported in his opinion by the then FIA president Jean Todt but F1’s chief executive at the time, Bernie Ecclestone, was adamant that sport and politics should not mix and that the race, which was backed financially by the Russian government and supported by Vladimir Putin, should go ahead. The race was not called off and it was duly run with Putin in attendance and presenting the winner’s trophy to Lewis Hamilton. Red Bull’s Verstappen also condemned the FIA for its treatment of former race director Michael Masi. Verstappen described Masi being sacked after events at the decisive and controversial season finale in Abu Dhabi as unacceptable.

35,"Thursday, 24 February 2022",2022-02-24,Ukraine crisis: commodities prices surge as stock markets slump,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/feb/24/gas-and-oil-prices-surge-amid-fears-of-global-energy-shortage-russia-ukraine,,"Global markets were thrown into turmoil on Thursday as the outbreak of war on European soil sent prices of commodities from oil and gas to wheat surging, while stock market plunged. The ramifications of a potentially prolonged conflict involving Europe’s primary supplier of gas sent a chill through markets, affecting prices across a broad spectrum of asset classes and investments.  Oil Brent crude hit $105 a barrel for the first time since August 2014, following a rise of more than 8% on international energy markets. The increase signalled a further rise on garage forecourts to record-breaking retail price for unleaded petrol of more than 155p a litre. Russia is the world’s second-largest oil producer and sells most of its crude to European refineries. It is also the largest supplier of natural gas to Europe, providing about two-fifths of its supply. Oil prices have surged more than $20 a barrel since the start of 2022 as the Ukraine crisis went unresolved, with fears that the US and Europe would impose sanctions on Russia’s energy sector, disrupting supplies, should the situation escalate. Gas The price of British gas for next-day delivery jumped 53% to 326p per therm as the invasion stoked fears of a disruption to global energy supplies. Dutch futures, a closely watched measure for European prices, were up 57% on contracts for delivery in March. Analysts at Investec think the renewed surge in gas price could force the energy regulator Ofgem to increase the household bills price cap to £3,000 in October. The 54% increase to nearly £2,000 announced earlier this month has already caused significant political fallout and sparked warnings of families having to choose between food and heating. Gold Typically seen as a safe haven in times of crisis, gold moved through $1,950 (£1,460) per ounce at one point before settling back, reaching levels not far away from its 2020 all-time high of $2,067. Russia and Ukraine are also large producers of important industrial metals such as palladium, nickel and aluminium, which analysts said could be in short supply over the coming months unless the war ends quickly. Russia produces 6% of the world’s aluminium and 7% of its mined nickel. Aluminium rose more than 5% to hit a record high of $3,466 a tonne in London. Nickel hit its highest level since May 2011 at $25,240 at one stage. Palladium, used in catalytic converters for cars, was trading more than 5% higher on Thursday afternoon, after touching $2,695.57 an ounce in the morning, up 7% to the highest level since August. Wheat Between them, Russia and Ukraine export a quarter of the world’s wheat, with Ukraine in particular known as the “breadbasket of Europe”. Short-term European wheat prices neared record highs on Thursday afternoon. Ukraine is also a major exporter of corn and barley, as well as a key source of cooking oils. Stock markets There was a broad sell-off of shares across Europe, and banks with big operations in Russia were especially hard hit, such as Austria’s Raiffeisenbank, Italy’s Unicredit and France’s Société Générale, following moves by governments across the continent and in the UK to impose sanctions on Russian banks and wealthy Russian individuals. The FTSE 100 index in London tumbled 291 points, or 3.8%, to 7,207, while the Dax in Frankfurt lost nearly 4%, the Cac in Paris dropped 3.8% and the Italian borsa in Milan closed 4.1% lower. On Wall Street, the Nasdaq pared earlier losses and was flat in the afternoon while the S&P 500 was down 0.9% and the Dow Jones slid 2%. Russian stocks plummeted as much as 50% when trading resumed on the Moscow stock exchange on Thursday morning following a temporary suspension. The dollar-denominated RTS index tanked 49.93% in early trading, and later traded 39% lower. The rouble-denominated Moex index fell 45% to 1,690.13, and was later down 33%. Thirty-one Russian companies are traded on the London Stock Exchange. State-owned banks Sberbank and VTB, along with state-backed oil and gas producers Gazprom and Rosneft have secondary listings in the UK while their primary listings remain in Moscow. A freeze on Russian bank assets in the UK nnounced by Boris Johnson sent shares in Sberbank plunging 74% while VTB held its value following a 30% drop since January. Gazprom, the mainly state-owned Russian energy company that trades some of its shares in London, was down 30%. Rosneft, the oil major which is 20%-owned by BP, dropped 50% and Lukoil fell 43%. The Anglo-Russian miner Polymetal was the top faller on the FTSE 100, down 38%, with the Russian mining group Evraz in second place, down 30%. Economic Impact Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk A prolonged war could pile pressure on economies including the UK, with the cost-of-living crisis a particular concern. Inflation is already at a 30-year high of 5.5% but with oil, gas and food ingredients all rising on the back of the Ukraine conflict, economic analysts are warning it could go still higher, while growth could be affected too. Tatiana Orlova, an economist at Oxford Economics, said: “We will incorporate higher European gas, oil and food prices over the medium term in our baseline, as well as more financial market disruption and tougher EU and US sanctions on Russia. The impact of these changes on our forecast for the global economy is significant, cutting 0.2 percentage points from GDP growth in 2022 and 0.1ppts in 2023.” ",0
36,"Thursday, 24 February 2022",2022-02-24,Russia’s invasion of Ukraine will change the face of Europe for ever,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/feb/24/russia-invasion-ukraine-europe-ukrainians,,"Why do we always make the same mistake? Oh, that’s only trouble in the Balkans, we say – and then an assassination in Sarajevo sparks the first world war. Oh, Adolf Hitler’s threat to Czechoslovakia is “a quarrel in a faraway country, between people of whom we know nothing” – and then we find ourselves in the second world war. Oh, Joseph Stalin’s takeover of distant Poland after 1945 is none of our business – and soon enough we have the cold war. Now we have done it again, not waking up until it is too late to the full implications of Vladimir Putin’s seizure of Crimea in 2014. And so, on Thursday 24 February 2022, we stand here again, clothed in nothing but the shreds of our lost illusions. At such moments we need courage and resolution but also wisdom. That includes care in our use of words. This is not the third world war. It is, however, already something much more serious than the Soviet invasions of Hungary in 1956 and Czechoslovakia in 1968. The five wars in former Yugoslavia in the 1990s were terrible, but the larger international dangers that flowed from them were not on this scale. There were brave resistance fighters in Budapest in 1956, but in Ukraine today we have an entire independent, sovereign state with a large army and a people who declare themselves determined to resist. If they don’t resist, at scale, this will be an occupation. If they do, this could be the largest war in Europe since 1945.  Against them is arrayed the overwhelming force of one of the strongest military powers in the world, with well-trained and equipped conventional forces and some 6,000 nuclear weapons. Russia is now the world’s largest rogue state. It is commanded by a president who, to judge from his hysterical rants this week, has departed the realm of rational calculation – as isolated dictators tend to do, sooner or later. To be clear: when, in his declaration of war on Thursday morning, he threatened anyone “who tries to stand in our way” with “consequences you have never encountered in your history”, he was threatening us with nuclear war. There will be a time to reflect on all our past mistakes. If, starting in 2014, we had got serious about helping to build up Ukraine’s capacity to defend itself, reduced European energy dependence on Russia, purged the sewage lakes of Russian dirty money swilling around London and imposed more sanctions on the Putin regime, we might be in a better place. But we have to start from where we are. In the early fog of a war that is just beginning, I see four things Europe and the rest of the west need to do. First, we need to secure the defence of every inch of Nato territory, especially at its eastern frontiers with Russia, Belarus and Ukraine, against all possible forms of attack, including cyber and hybrid ones. For 70 years, the security of west European countries including Britain has ultimately depended on the credibility of the “one for all and all for one” promise of article 5 of the Nato treaty. Like it or not, the longtime security of London is now inextricably intertwined with that of the Estonian city of Narva; that of Berlin with Białystok in Poland; that of Rome with that of Cluj-Napoca in Romania. 01:56Russia has invaded Ukraine: what we know so far – video report Second, we have to offer all the support that we can to the Ukrainians, short of breaching the threshold that would bring the west into a direct war with Russia. Those Ukrainians who choose to stay and to resist will be fighting by military and civilian means to defend the freedom of their country, as they have every possible right in law and conscience to do, and as we would do for our own countries. Inevitably, the limited scope of our response will lead to bitter disappointment among them. Emails from Ukrainian friends speak, for example, of the west imposing a no-fly zone, denying Ukrainian airspace to Russian planes. Nato is not going to do that. Like the Czechs in 1938, like the Poles in 1945, like Hungarians in 1956, Ukrainians will say: “You, our fellow Europeans, have abandoned us.” But there are still things we can do. We can continue to supply weapons, communications and other equipment to those who are entirely legitimately resisting armed force with armed force. As important in the medium term, we can help those who will be using the well-tried techniques of civil resistance against a Russian occupation and any attempt to impose a puppet government. We must also stand ready to assist the many Ukrainians who will flee westward. Third, the sanctions we impose on Russia should go beyond what has already been prepared. Beside comprehensive economic measures, there should be expulsions of Russians in any way connected with the Putin regime. Putin, with his war chest of more than $600bn, and his hand on the gas tap to Europe, has prepared for this, so sanctions will take time to have their full effect. In the end, it will have to be the Russians themselves who turn round and say: “Enough. Not in our name.” Many of them, including the Nobel prizewinner Dmitry Muratov, already express their horror at this war. Likewise, the Ukrainian journalist Nataliya Gumanyuk has written movingly of a Russian journalist crying on the telephone with her as the Russian tanks moved in. That horror will only increase when the corpses of young Russian men return in body bags – and as the full economic and reputational impact becomes apparent at home in Russia. Russians will be the first and last victims of Vladimir Putin. That brings me to a final, vital point: we must be prepared for a long struggle. It will take years, probably decades, for all the consequences of 24 February to be played out. In the short term, the prospects for Ukraine are desperately bleak. But I think at this moment of the wonderful title of a book about the Hungarian revolution of 1956: Victory of a Defeat. Almost everyone in the west has now woken up to the fact that Ukraine is a European country being attacked and dismembered by a dictator. Kyiv today is a city full of journalists from all over the world. This experience will shape their views of Ukraine for ever. We had forgotten, in the years of our post-cold war illusions, that this is how nations write themselves on to the mental map of Europe: in blood, sweat and tears.

37,"Thursday, 24 February 2022",2022-02-24,Two former European prime ministers quit boards of Russian companies,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/feb/24/two-former-european-prime-ministers-quit-boards-of-russian-companies,,"Two former European leaders have quit the boards of Russian companies in response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Finland’s former prime minister Esko Aho said he had resigned as a director of Russia’s largest bank, Sberbank, while the former Italian prime minister Matteo Renzi announced he had quit the board of Russia’s largest car-sharing service, Delimobil.  Their departures highlighted the pressure on western business leaders and politicians to reassess their ties with Russian companies after Moscow’s full-scale attack on its neighbour. Aho, who was an independent director of Sberbank, had been a member of the lender’s supervisory board since 2016. He told the Finnish newspaper Turun Sanomat on Thursday morning that he had “initiated measures to withdraw from the board”. A page on Sberbank’s website showing Aho’s board positions was updated on Thursday. It stated he was “considered to have retired from the supervisory board … upon a personal request”. Italian media reported that Renzi, who remains the leader of the Italia Viva party, had stepped down from the board of directors of Delimobil. The former prime minister had taken up the position last August at the car-sharing firm, which was founded in 2015 by the Italian businessman Vincenzo Trani, the president of the Italian-Russian chamber of commerce. The resignations will increase the criticism of prominent former European politicians who have not cut their ties with Russian corporations, including the former German chancellor Gerhard Schröder. At the beginning of February, Schröder was nominated to join the board of the Russian state-owned energy company Gazprom. Schröder, who led Germany from 1998 to 2005, remains the chairman of the Russian state energy firm Rosneft, and also sits on the shareholders’ committee at Nord Stream, the company behind the controversial gas pipeline linking Russia and Germany. The former Social Democrat chancellor has come in for frequent criticism since leaving office for his close ties with Russia, and his personal friendship with Vladimir Putin. Schröder issued a statement on Thursday calling for caution in the use of sanctions against Russia, saying they could endanger a return to peace and dialogue. Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk “Much has been said in recent years about mistakes and failures in the relationship between the west and Russia. And there were many mistakes – on both sides,” Schröder wrote on his page on the networking website LinkedIn. “But Russia’s security interests also do not justify the use of military means.” Schröder sits on the board of Rosneft alongside the former Austrian foreign affairs minister Karin Kneissl, as well as western business leaders including the current and former chief executives of BP, Bernard Looney and Bob Dudley. The London-headquartered oil company BP owns almost a fifth of Rosneft.",0

The prices of wholesale gas and oil soared on the back of the news, leading to predictions of further rises in domestic bills.  The AA and RAC warned that petrol and diesel prices would start rising within days after crude oil prices reached record levels. Analysts are warning that household gas and electricity bills could rise by a further £600-£1,000 a year – to as much as £3,000 – after the Russian invasion pushed up wholesale gas prices 28% on Thursday morning. Although UK households are not heavily reliant on Russian gas, concerns that supplies from the country will be disrupted have pushed up prices on the wholesale market. After Germany halted the approval of the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline this week, the Russian politician Dmitry Medvedev warned that natural gas prices could double in Europe. Oil prices have risen to a seven-year high over concerns about supplies from Russia. Energy bills The market turmoil is expected to cause further hardship for those already struggling to heat and light their homes. On 1 April, the average dual fuel bill is already set to rise to a record £1,971, and more pain could be on the way when the regulator Ofgem reviews the maximum rate that suppliers can charge in the autumn. Roger Bird, the head of energy trading and risk at the consultancy Advantage Utilities, warned that volatility in the energy market in the coming months could easily result in the cap increasing by £600 or more. Should Russia cut Europe off from its gas supplies, the continent would be at the mercy of a “cut-throat” industry that often sees gas supplies circle oceans and be redirected to the highest bidder, he said. If crude oil prices were to hit $120 a barrel it could mean a price of £1.60 a litre at the pumps. Photograph: Finnbarr Webster/Getty Images “The worst-case scenario could see wholesale prices far exceed the astonishing spike previously seen around December 2021.” Martin Young, a senior energy analyst at Investec, was even more pessimistic. In a note sent to City clients, he warned that British households could face “devastating” rises in their energy bills if wholesale prices remain at their current levels. “The jump in electricity and gas prices of recent days has sent our October tariff cap estimate soaring above £3,000,” he said. “This could be devastating for UK households with elevated fuel poverty, and an ‘eat or heat’ dilemma.” Sarah Coles, a senior personal finance analyst at the financial services firm Hargreaves Lansdown, said: “Millions of people have fallen into the fuel poverty gap, and war between Ukraine and Russia could push even more of us over the edge.” Petrol prices Petrol and diesel reached record levels in the UK on Wednesday, with unleaded at nearly 149.5p a litre and diesel at almost 153p, and the RAC said petrol could rise as high as £1.60 a litre. British Gas guarantees UK energy supplies are safe after Russia invasionRead more “Russia’s actions will now push petrol pump prices up to £1.50 very soon,” said Simon Williams, the RAC’s fuel spokesperson. “The question then becomes where will this stop and how much can drivers take, just as many are using their cars more and returning to workplaces.” Williams said if oil prices rose to $110 (£82) a barrel, “there’s a very real danger the average price of petrol would hit £1.55 a litre”. He said: “This would cause untold financial difficulties for many people who depend on their cars for getting to work and running their lives as it would skyrocket the cost of a full tank to £85.” If prices were to hit $120 a barrel that could translate to a price of £1.60 a litre at the pumps and £88 for a full tank, he added.

The first is that market increases often fall back after surges earlier in the day or week, and that the cost of petrol does not go up at the same rate as oil during global events. Finally, the fuel consumption of vehicles is lower coming out of winter. Edmund King, the AA president, said: “Prices at the pumps still vary considerably and tend to be cheaper when there is supermarket competition. To conserve fuel, drivers should consider cutting out short journeys, car sharing and eco driving. Cutting speed and driving more smoothly can lead to 15% reductions in fuel consumption.”",0

While shock, anger and defiance were among the common sentiments, events in the early hours of Thursday morning had also heralded difficult personal dilemmas for many, such as Aleksandra Legosteva, a tech worker, and her mother, Olena, who had come to visit on Saturday.  “I don’t want her to go back,” said Legosteva, who told of a largely sleepless night as the family monitored Russia’s invasion and worried about relatives in northern Ukraine who were stockpiling food and other supplies. Like others, she was eager for the UK government to impose “sweeping sanctions” on Russia, while calls for military assistance and British military boots on the grounds were a common refrain among the crowd. Yuriy Yurchuk, 35, a principal singer at the Royal Opera House, said he had been due to perform at Moscow’s Bolshoi theatre in two weeks’ time but that would now not happen. “There’s still a place for talking but there should be a comprehensive response to what is happening in Ukraine, including a military one and also international condemnation. Otherwise what is the UN for?” added Yurchuk. Ukrainians demonstrate outside Downing Street in London. Photograph: Andy Hall/The Observer Ukrainian flags, large and small, were scattered throughout the crowd, along with homemade placards variously condemning Vladimir Putin as a war criminal or drawing a link between his regime and that of the Soviet Union. The bishop of the Ukrainian Catholic Eparchy of the Holy Family of London, the Right Rev Kenneth Nowakowski, was among those who had gathered in London. “I don’t want to criticise the British government because we’re grateful for what they’ve done so far but there is so much more that can and should be done now,” he said. “It’s also worth remembering that this is a war that has been going on for eight years now. The rest of the world is now waking up to it and the fact that Putin may not just stop at Ukraine.” Ukrainians protest in London against the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Photograph: Andy Hall/The Observer While those gathered were almost entirely Ukrainian, a small group of young Russians working in sectors ranging from IT to fashion were also present, though they declined to give their names – such were their concerns at the consequences of speaking out against Putin. “I literally couldn’t look at my colleagues in the eye this morning,” said one woman, who spoke of a feeling of shame. Away from the protests, other Ukrainians in Britain expressed their shock and anger as they struggled to maintain contact with family and friends fleeing from or sheltering in areas under bombardment. Members of the diaspora described their fear on hearing from relatives in Ukraine that their home towns had been bombed in Russian airstrikes. Tetyana Vovnyanko, who lives in London, said close family who live near the city of Uman, between Kyiv and Odesa, have sought safety in the countryside. “I listened this morning to the news that there were airstrikes and a shell landed in the middle of the town centre and a few people were killed,” she said, adding that her nephew and his family in Kyiv had also moved to the countryside. Vovnyanko, co-founder of British-Ukrainian Aid, which supports people suffering from the armed conflict and humanitarian crisis in Ukraine, added: “I’m extremely worried because initially we thought that the attacks will be mostly towards the eastern part of Ukraine, along the frontline. And we thought that possibly there will be airstrikes on Kyiv, as American intelligence services said. 03:37Why has Putin’s Russia waged war on Ukraine? – video explainer “But today we realised that all Ukraine, even relatively distant towns from the frontline, are affected. I had a brief exchange with my PhD supervisor who is living in Odesa. There were airstrikes there and she’s very scared about her life.” Olesya Khromeychuk, director of cultural centre the Ukrainian Institute London, said she spent the night anxiously following reports of Russian attacks across Ukraine. “As we were anticipating, this is all over Ukraine,” she said. “I hear of explosions in my home town Lviv, near the Polish border, which was considered the safest place in Ukraine.” The historian said many of her friends and relatives were trying to get their parents to safety. “None of my friends have left Kyiv yet, although some are trying to get their parents out. Others were in bomb shelters. But people from Berdyansk and Zaporizhia, in the south-east, are trying to leave because it’s been bombed heavily and it’s extremely dangerous to be there.” Petro Kormylo, archivist for the Edinburgh branch of the Association of Ukrainians in Great Britain, said his relatives in north-east Ukraine had reported skirmishes with invading Russian forces. Kormylo, 71, from Dumfries, said two of his relatives had recently joined the territorial defence force, set up by the Ukraine government in January to help the armed forces resist a Russian invasion. “I think on a paramilitary level or partisan level, you’re going to find Ukrainians fighting in skirmishes everywhere. If you can think back to Northern Ireland, it’s going to be 50 times worse than that.”",0
41,"Thursday, 24 February 2022",2022-02-24,Can anyone in Russia stop Putin now?,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/feb/24/ukraine-russia-vladimir-putin-kremlin,,"Western leaders have spent the past 20 years trying to guess what Vladimir Putin “really wants”. Very often, it’s enough just to read his words, very carefully. Because usually he means exactly what he says. And in the case of his early morning television address announcing Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, his words and hints about his intentions were truly terrifying. It would be good to start with his warning to the west not to interfere, because just as people like David Davis call for the west to provide air support to Ukraine, Putin had this to say: “Russia will respond immediately, and the consequences will be such as you have never seen in your entire history. All the necessary decisions in this regard have been taken.”  There can be little doubt that what he means is that he is prepared to deploy nuclear weapons against any country that takes military action to help Ukraine. He added, with great emphasis: “I hope that my words will be heard.” Apparently not by Davis. As for Putin’s intentions in Ukraine itself, there was a strong indication that he plans to incorporate the Donbas (including the entire Donetsk and Luhansk regions, most of which are still in Ukrainian hands) into the Russian Federation, just as he did with Crimea in 2014. He said that the peoples living in Ukraine (by which he meant the Russians) have the right to make a “free choice”, and added that in 2014 Russia “was obliged to protect the people of Crimea” and that those people then chose to “be with their historic homeland, Russia”. There is no other way to interpret those words than as a threat to annex the eastern regions of Ukraine. As for his declared intention to “demilitarise and denazify” Ukraine, it is hard to see how this could be achieved without a wholesale occupation of the country and change of government. True, Putin denied that his purpose was to occupy Ukraine. But there was a big “but”: there were, he said, “statements” coming from the west to the effect that there was no need any more to “abide by the documents setting forth the outcomes of world war two”. So it’s goodbye Yalta, it seems, as Putin sets about redrawing the map of Europe. So what hope is there that Putin can be deterred from going this far? Inside Russia, opposition voices have been utterly squashed. Politicians who might have led public protests, such as Alexei Navalny, are in prison, and his entire network of activists has been outlawed. Would-be protesters in Moscow were detained as soon as they left their flats. The editor of Novaya Gazeta, Dmitry Muratov, who won last year’s Nobel peace prize, put out a desperately sad statement: “President Putin has ordered our country to start a war with Ukraine. And there is nobody to stop this war. For that reason, as well as grief, I feel shame.” Anyone who watched Monday’s meeting of Putin with his security council will understand Muratov’s despair. This was a gathering of those who in theory advise the president, whose job is to assess options and their outcomes. Not one of them dared step out of line. They knew what Putin wanted them to say and they said it. When the foreign intelligence chief, Sergei Naryshkin, fluffed his lines, he got a tongue-lashing (shown on TV) from the president. A couple of officials did suggest giving diplomacy a few days longer, but they were ignored. Dmitry Medvedev was seen as a flickering light of reason when he swapped the presidency with Putin in 2008-12, but on Monday he too fell into line. There is, literally, nobody in Russia who can stop this war, because Putin has total control. The ostensibly elected parliament – the Duma and the Federation Council – is full of his placemen. The presidential administration and the foreign ministry almost certainly contain doubters, people who might want to point out that invasion is hardly compatible with the president’s statements about Ukrainians and Russians being “one people”. But I would be astonished if any of them offered to resign. Can the west stop him? The history of sanctions, ever tougher and more far-reaching, is ignominious. Putin sneers at them, because he will always put his version of what Russia needs for its security above economic considerations. He also has a huge reserve fund to soften the blow. All wars end in either victory for one side or in a negotiated settlement. Today, the prospect of the latter appears bleak. I find it hard to comprehend why it would have been so wrong to agree to the negotiations Putin wanted last year, to seriously review Europe’s security system, if that had a chance of avoiding the war that has now begun. Surely a neutral Ukraine, safe between its neighbours, would be preferable to war. But the time for that is gone. Putin is now hell-bent on revenge for what he perceives as years of western slights. He alone will decide his neighbour’s fate. Angus Roxburgh is a former BBC Moscow correspondent and consultant to the Kremlin.

But we also need to be clear-eyed about it, and face the costs. Economics can’t be separated from politics, and neither can be separated from history. Here are eight sobering realities: 1. Will the economic sanctions now being put into effect stop Putin from seeking to take over all of Ukraine? No. They will complicate Russia’s global financial transactions but they will not cripple the Russian economy. After Russia annexed Ukraine’s Crimean peninsula in 2014, the US and its allies imposed economic sanctions which slowed the Russian economy temporarily, but Russia soon rebounded. Since then, Russia has taken steps to lessen its reliance on foreign debt and investment, which means that similar sanctions will have less effect. In addition, the rise of cryptocurrencies and other digital assets allow Russia to bypass bank transfers, which are the control points for sanctions. Bottom line: the sanctions already imposed or threatened could reduce Russia’s gross domestic product, but only by a few percentage points.  Biden to address nation as Russia invades Ukraine – US politics liveRead more 2. What sort of sanctions would seriously damage Russia? Sanctions on Russia’s enormous oil and gas exports could cause substantial harm. Russia produces 10 million barrels of oil a day, which is about 10 percent of global demand. It ranks third in world oil production (behind the United States and Saudi Arabia). It ranks second in natural gas (behind the US), according to the US Energy Information Administration. 3. Then why not impose sanctions on them? Because that would seriously harm consumers in Europe and the US – pushing up energy prices and worsening inflation (now running at 7.5% annually in the US, a 40-year high). Although the US imports very little Russian oil or natural gas, oil and natural gas markets are global – which means shortages that push up prices in one part of the world will have similar effects elsewhere. The price of oil in the US is already approaching $100 a barrel, up from about $65 a year ago. The price of gas at the pump is averaging $3.53 a gallon, according to AAA. For most Americans, that gas-pump price is the single most important indicator of inflation, not just because they fuel their cars with gas but because the cost is emblazoned in big numbers outside every gas station in America. (The biggest beneficiaries of these price increases, by the way: energy companies like Halliburton, Occidental Petroleum and Schlumberger, which are now leading the S&P 500. Anyone in favor of putting a windfall profits tax on them?) 4. Will stronger sanctions weaken Putin’s control over Russia? Possibly. But they could also have the opposite effect – enabling Putin to fuel Russia’s suspicions toward the west and stir up even more Russian nationalism. The harshest US measures would cause the average Russian to pay higher prices for food and clothing or devalue pensions and savings accounts because of a crash in the ruble or Russian markets, but these might be seen as necessary sacrifices that rally Russians around Putin. 01:56Russia has invaded Ukraine: what we know so far – video report 5. Any other foreign policy consequences we should be watching? In a word: China. Russia’s concern about the west has already led to a rapprochement with China. A strong alliance between the two most powerful world autocracies could be worrisome. 6. What about domestic politics here in the US? Foreign policy crises tend to drive domestic policy off the headlines, and weaken reform movements. Putin’s aggression in Ukraine has already quieted conversations in America about voting rights, filibuster reform, and Build Back Better – at least for now. Large-scale war, if it ever comes to that, deadens reform. The first world war brought the progressive era to a halt. The second ended FDR’s New Deal. Vietnam stopped Lyndon Johnson’s Great Society. Wars and the threat of wars also legitimate huge military expenditures and giant military bureaucracies. America is already spending $776bn a year on the military, a sum greater than the next 10 giant military powers (including Russia and China) together. Wars also create fat profits for big corporations in war industries. The possibility of war also distracts the public from failures of domestic politics, as the Spanish-American war did for President William McKinley and the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq did for George W Bush. (Hopefully, Biden’s advisers aren’t thinking this way.) 7. Could the sanctions lead to real war between Russia and the west? Unlikely. Americans don’t want Americans to die in order to protect Ukraine (most Americans don’t even know where Ukraine is, let alone our national interest in protecting it). And neither Russia nor the US wants to be annihilated in a nuclear holocaust. But international crises such as this one always run the risk of getting out of hand. Russia and the US have giant stockpiles of nuclear weapons. What if one is set off accidentally? More likely: what if Russia cyber-attacks the US, causing massive damage to US utilities, communications, banks, hospitals, and transportation networks here? What if Russian troops threaten Nato members along Ukraine’s borders? Under these conditions, might the US be willing to commit ground troops? Those who have fought ground and air wars know war is hell. Subsequent generations tend to forget. By the eve of the first world war, many in America and Britain spoke of the glories of large-scale warfare because so few remembered actual warfare. Today, most Americans have no direct experience of war. Afghanistan and Iraq were abstractions for most of us. Vietnam has faded from our collective memory. 8. What is Putin really after? Not just keeping Ukraine out of Nato, because Nato itself isn’t Putin’s biggest worry. After all, Hungary and Poland are Nato members but are governed in ways that resemble Russia more than western democracies. Putin’s real fear is liberal democracy, which poses a direct threat to authoritarian “strongmen” like him (just as it did to Donald Trump). Putin wants to keep liberal democracy far away from Russia. Putin’s means of keeping western liberal democracy at bay isn’t just to invade Ukraine, of course. It’s also to stoke division inside the west by fueling racist nationalism in western Europe and the United States. In this, Trump and Trumpism continue to be Putin’s most important ally.

43,"Thursday, 24 February 2022",2022-02-24,What can the west do about Russia invading Ukraine?,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/24/russia-invading-ukraine-putin-nato-what-can-west-do,,"In the wake of what the Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, described as Russia’s “fully fledged invasion of Ukraine”, the west has to decide how to respond to what France’s Emmanuel Macron has called a turning point in European history. Yet can the west now offer Ukraine more than a mixture of prayers, sanctions and diplomatic demarches? Throughout this conflict western intelligence has shown it has been able to predict Putin’s next step, but less capable of stopping it. Boris Johnson told the Ukrainian people “we are with you”, but what this western solidarity means in practice is now up for debate.  The 30-nation Nato alliance will stick to its pledge that it will never send forces to protect Ukraine as a non-Nato member. Backbench Tory calls to give Ukraine air support have no support in Nato. Instead the west will test Russia’s resolve through tough sanctions and by some countries providing arms if there is a resistance. The coordinated sanctions in Washington, London, Berlin and Brussels being announced on Thursday are billed as massive, but Putin sits on a $600bn (£450bn) war chest and will benefit from oil prices soaring past $100 a barrel. That makes him less dependent on the west to raise capital than five years ago, and such is his dominance of the Russian media that the chances of internal protests pressurising, let alone toppling, the 69-year-old president look minimal. The oligarchs may complain if sanctions are placed on them, but Putin is in too deep to retreat. One London-based diplomat said this week after viewing Russia’s televised and cowed national security meeting: “We used to talk about Putin’s inner circle. There is no inner circle. There is only Putin.” Another said: “The only thing that will change Russian public opinion is the mothers of Russia seeing the bodybags.” Nikolai Petrov from the Chatham House thinktank warned “all infrastructure of political opponents and opposition has been destroyed, making it much easier for the Kremlin to to mobilise public opinion”. 01:56Russia has invaded Ukraine: what we know so far – video report Dire predictions by the British of Putin being mired in a battlefield quagmire will now be tested. Many Ukrainians appear on western media to attest that Putin has underestimated Ukraine’s will to fight. They insist they will not tolerate a puppet government loyal to Moscow. But the long queues of traffic fleeing Kyiv in the westward direction speaks to another story. It is as likely that Ukraine’s prisons will be filled with dissidents. In the short term there will be a debate, including in Germany, about whether to arm the resistance, with some Green party and CDU leaders already advocating this. The German foreign minister, Annalena Baerbock, at the weekend said this was not the moment for Germany to make a 180-degree turn on such a strategic policy. Yet the debate is live. The former German defence minister Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer said: “I’m so angry at us for historically failing. After Georgia, Crimea and Donbas, we have not prepared anything that would have really deterred Putin.” Keir Giles, also from Chatham House, urged the west to be cautious. “Looking at Russia’s 100% success record on suppressing resistance movements in territories it has occupied – often using medieval levels of savagery and inflicting terror on the civilian population – we ask what would aid to a resistance achieve and would it make the situation better worse or better.” The images of destruction in Aleppo, Grozny and Afghanistan show how merciless the Russian military can be. Stoltenberg has said that it is a matter for individual nations to decide the help they provide to any resistance. But the risks are high. In his speech announcing the invasion, Putin warned outsiders tempted to interfere that there would be “consequences you have never encountered in your history” – a chilling veiled reference to nuclear war. There is also a danger that an insurgency would exacerbate a refugee crisis likely to be triggered across central Europe. Plans are in infancy in the EU’s Frontex border agency to prepare for the arrival of hundreds of thousands of refugees. Some diplomats are optimistic that, unlike with Syria in 2015, there will not be a political backlash, pointing out many Ukrainians have already been welcomed to Europe. As many as 15,000 Ukrainians already live in Berlin. But autocrats have learned that refugees are weapons of war. The British foreign secretary, Liz Truss, has clearly indicated that there is a serious risk that Putin, judging by his words, will not stop at Ukraine, but wants to restore Russia’s empire, and remove western forces from all former Warsaw pact countries. Ben Wallace, the defence secretary, said Putin had gone “full tonto”, and almost every western politician who returned from Moscow was disturbed by his demeanour and inability to focus on realistic solutions to the crisis. It means once Ukraine is swallowed by Putin, Russia will be able to station forces – land, air and missile – in bases in western Ukraine as well as Belarus, which has effectively lost independence. He may not invade the Baltic states, but he is in a better strategic position to demand a retreat by Nato to Warsaw pact boundaries and a land corridor through Poland to link Kaliningrad, the headquarters of the Russian Baltic fleet. It will mean high defence spending, less dependence on Russian energy and more troops on Nato’s frontiers. Finland and Sweden may seek to join Nato. If Putin wanted less Nato, he may get more. Finally, the west has to confront questions about the validity of the whole postwar diplomatic security architecture. On Wednesday night UN diplomats gathered to condemn Russia at an emergency meeting, one chaired by Russia, this month’s presidents of the UN security council. It symbolised the degree to which the UN has become utterly compromised. But there may have been one diplomatic voice in New York that will disturb the west most – that of the Chinese envoy. In his brief remarks he remained studiously on the fence, refusing to condemn Russia and knowing the west’s anguish may provide it with nothing but opportunities ahead.",0
44,"Thursday, 24 February 2022",2022-02-24,How will Russia’s assault on Ukraine affect UK gas supplies?,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/feb/24/how-will-russia-assault-ukraine-affect-uk-gas-supplies,,"With Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine under way, the Kremlin’s grip on the gas taps and pipelines that supply heat and electricity to millions of homes and businesses in Europe is all too apparent. Gas is already in tight supply globally and has reached record market price highs in recent months.  In the UK, this has triggered an energy crisis, including the collapse of multiple electricity suppliers and a rise in household gas and electricity bills that has contributed to a growing cost-of-living squeeze. That pressure could be about to increase. As Russia began its assault on Ukraine, prices rose again. The UK benchmark was up 32% to 281p per therm on Thursday, while the closely watched Dutch future gained 31% on contracts for March delivery. One analyst predicted UK household energy bills could surge past £3000 later this year. So, could Europe’s energy crisis become a catastrophe? How vulnerable are the UK’s gas supplies? “We must collectively cease the dependence on Russian oil and gas that for too long has given Putin his grip on western politics,” Boris Johnson said on Thursday. The good news, for the UK’s security of supply at least, is that less than 5% of our gas comes from Russian imports. About half comes from vast, though rapidly dwindling, North Sea reserves. Another third is sourced from Norway, while the rest comes in via pipelines connecting the UK to Europe, or in the form of liquefied natural gas (LNG), which is transported by tankers typically from Qatar or the US. All of this means, according to a report by the Oxford Institute of Energy Studies, that Britain is “unlikely to face a physical shortage of supplies”. 0Boris Johnson promises ‘massive package of sanctions’ after Russian invasion of Ukraine – video The bad news is that Russia typically supplies 30-40% of Europe’s gas, meaning it still wields huge influence over prices, which are already eye-wateringly high. The UK’s market is closely connected to markets in Europe, so a price rise in Germany or the Netherlands means British suppliers must pay more to get hold of it. In January, the US bank Goldman Sachs said it expected gas prices to be twice as high as normal until 2025 and that was before Russia launched its attack on Ukraine. On Thursday, analysts at Investec said they believe the gas and electricity price surge of recent days could force the regulator Ofgem to take the household bills price cap “soaring above £3000”, hot on the heels of this month’s 54% increase to £1971. Nor can the UK turn to stored reserves of gas for relief from market prices. Storage capacity is very low by international standards since British Gas’s owner, Centrica, shut down the Rough facility off the coast of Yorkshire. How vulnerable are Europe’s gas supplies? Energy prices surge as Russian invasion of Ukraine stokes fears of global shortagesRead more Very. Russian gas flows into Europe via a complex network of pipelines that run through Ukraine, Belarus and Poland to Germany, including Yamal and Nord Stream 1. From Germany, pipelines carry gas to the rest of western Europe and through to the UK. If war in Ukraine were to damage or choke off those supply lines, it could cause severe market volatility and a shutdown of European factories to help conserve gas. “It’s possible to use other routes, particularly the Yamal pipeline through Poland and Germany,” said Michael Bradshaw, professor of global energy at Warwick Business School. “But that depends on Russia being willing to do that.” Does the UK government have a contingency plan? So far, the government has stuck to the line that “thanks to our diverse mix of nuclear, natural gas and renewable technologies, the UK has one of the most reliable energy systems in the world”. But while security of supply does not appear to be at risk, price pressure could have huge ramifications. The efforts of the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, to help households cope with rising costs involves giving them £200 off their energy bills, with this “loan” paid back at a rate of £40 a year over five years from 2023. The idea is that part of the cost is postponed until markets return to normal. If the Ukraine conflict is prolonged, prices could remain higher for longer, meaning bills will still be high when households have to start repaying the government. When it comes to securing alternative supplies, LNG from the US and Qatar is one option. Officials were reportedly in talks late last year with Qatar over a deal that could result in the gas-rich nation supplying extra cargoes of gas in the event of an energy emergency, according to the Financial Times. But the government denied requesting that Qatar act as a “supplier of last resort”. Bradshaw warns that if LNG become a fallback option for Europe and the UK, particularly amid increasing demand for it in Asia, the maths might not add up. British Gas guarantees UK energy supplies are safe after Russia invasionRead more “The problem might then be that there isn’t enough LNG to make up for shortage of pipeline gas,” he said. “We’re in uncharted territory.” How high could gas prices climb? At 280p per therm, UK short-term gas prices are already more than seven times higher than this time last year and Tom Marzec-Manser, a senior gas expert at ICIS, thinks they could return to the record levels above 450p, reached in December last year. “I don’t think it’s unreasonable to believe that gas markets could return to the highs we saw late last year if things were to escalate to the point that gas supplies were affected,” Marzec-Manser said. For now, a few lucky breaks have helped to keep soaring gas markets in check, he added. Gas demand in Asia is lower, which allowed Europe to receive a record number of LNG deliveries from January. However, a major gas supply disruption could be enough to cause gas prices to soar back to record levels and the weather is always a factor. “We’ve got to hope we don’t have another cold spell,” said Bradshaw.",0

The findings come as Russia launches an invasion of Ukraine.  The joint research was published by the National Cyber Security Centre in the UK and US agencies including the National Security Agency. It warned that a Russian state-backed hacker group known as Sandworm had developed a new type of malware called Cyclops Blink, which targets firewall devices made by the manufacturer Watchguard to protect computers against hacks. Ukraine president vows to defend country as Russia says separatists ‘ask for military help’Read more The sophisticated virus can withstand typical remedies including reboots, the report said. The findings come as the UK and US, allies to Ukraine, are on high alert for Russian state-sponsored hacks. The agencies added that their statement was a “routine advisory” not directly linked to the situation in Ukraine. However, the US cybersecurity firm Mandiant said the announcement was a reminder of the damage that could be inflicted by Sandworm, which has been blamed for the devastating NotPetya attack on Ukraine in 2017. John Hultquist, a vice-president at Mandiant Threat Intelligence, said Sandworm remained a “capable and clever” adversary. “In light of the crisis in Ukraine we are very concerned about this actor, who has surpassed all others we track in terms of the aggressive cyber-attacks and information operations they have conducted,” he said. “No other Russian actor has been so brazen and successful in disrupting critical infrastructure in Ukraine and elsewhere.” Ukraine has suffered a string of cyber-attacks that Kyiv has blamed on Russia. Moscow, which is caught up in a mounting confrontation with the west over Ukraine, has denied any involvement. Wednesday saw a massive distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack that targeted websites of Ukraine’s government and banks. “At about 4pm, another mass DDoS attack on our state began. We have relevant data from a number of banks,” said Mykhailo Fedorov, minister of digital transformation, adding that the parliament website was also hit. Ukrainian authorities said this week they had seen online warnings that hackers were preparing to launch major attacks on government agencies, banks and the defense sector. Wednesday’s hack was consistent with the country’s tactics to distract and disrupt adversaries while “providing a level of plausible deniability”, said Rick Holland, chief information security officer at the cybersecurity firm Digital Shadows. “Russia didn’t just decide to invade Ukraine this week,” he said. “Military planners have prepared for this campaign years in advance. Disinformation, false flags, DDoS attacks, and destructive wiper malware are a part of Russian military doctrine; the battle plans have been drawn up and are now being executed.” The White House said on Wednesday that it was in touch with Ukrainian authorities about their cybersecurity needs, in the wake of the fresh cyber-attack, which the US government has not yet attributed. “We are in conversations with Ukraine regarding their cyber-related needs including as recently as today and we’re going to move with urgency to assess the nature and extent of this, what steps need to be taken, and therefore a response,” the White House press secretary, Jen Psaki, said.

The battle for Kyiv: ‘People are grieving. This is already a tragedy’Read more  Almost exactly 30 years after the devastating siege of Sarajevo, another major European capital came under heavy bombardment with shells hitting apartment blocks, driving up the civilian death toll.  The onslaught of bombing intensified on Friday night, accompanied by artillery rounds and heavy gunfire on the city’s streets. In a bleak statement, Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, warned that several cities were under attack. “This night will be the hardest … We must withstand. The night will be very hard, but sunrise will come.” In the hours after he spoke, multiple explosions were reported across the capital amid reports that Russian troops were advancing on the city centre. After the second day of the invasion, it was clear that it was being fiercely resisted, but also that Russia had much more military might yet to be unleashed on its neighbour. Ukrainians prepared a last-ditch defence of their capital, with barricades, and called for civilians to arm themselves with molotov cocktails. According to US estimates, Russia has fired 200 ballistic and cruise missiles at Ukraine, mostly hitting military targets but some landing in residential areas. As human rights groups accused Russia of war crimes, the prosecutor at the International Criminal Court issued a reminder he has jurisdiction to investigate atrocities committed inside Ukraine. US defence officials said that the Russian offensive was facing stiffer resistance than its commanders had anticipated. They had so far not established unchallenged air superiority, for example. But the US estimates that Moscow had only committed a third of the attacking force it had mustered around Ukraine’s borders in recent months. According to the Pentagon, 10 amphibious landing ships unloaded thousands of naval infantry to the west of Mariupol, potentially cutting off the port city. In a televised address marked by more of the extreme rhetoric that has accompanied the invasion, Vladimir Putin described the the government in Kyiv as as “terrorists” and “a gang of drug addicts and neo-Nazis”. Earlier in the day, Zelenskiy posted a video of himself and his aides outside the presidential office to counter Russian media rumours that he had fled. “We are here. We are in Kyiv. We are defending Ukraine.” 01:02'We are defending our country alone,' Zelenskiy tells Ukrainians as Russia approaches Kyiv – video Western intelligence agencies have predicted that Zelenskiy and his top officials could be targeted for assassination as Russia seeks to decapitate the country. “It’s clear the kind of vitriol coming from Russia about the Ukrainian leadership, so I think we can expect that they would be targets for Russian forces coming into the city,” one western official said. Russia was forced to vote alone at the UN security council on Friday night against a resolution deploring its actions. As Russia holds a veto, the resolution was not upheld, but the US and its allies score a small diplomatic victory by persuading China not to vote with Russia but abstain, by slightly watering down the language. They were unable to win over India and the United Arab Emirates, who also abstained. Tremors from the invasion continued to spread around the world on Friday, demonstrating the potential for the already disastrous conflict to spill over Ukraine’s borders. Nato activated its rapid response force which had been established as a contingency in the event of a serious threat on the alliance’s flank. The Kremlin also issued a direct threat to Finland and Sweden, which have been openly contemplating Nato membership as a result of the invasion. “Their accession to Nato can have detrimental consequences … and face military and political consequences,” the foreign ministry spokeswoman, Maria Zakharova, said. Earlier in the day, barricades went up around the city as its defenders set up positions on bridges prepared for an onslaught, more Russian troops converged on the city from three directions, and Putin urged Ukraine’s military to seize power from the elected government, and bow to his demands to disarm and rule out Nato membership. Streams of people – mostly women and children, since Ukrainian men aged 18-60 are forbidden to leave – crossed into Hungary, Poland and Romania, with 15-hour queues reported at border points. Guards fired warning shots to prevent a stampede at Kyiv’s central station as thousands tried to force their way on to evacuation trains. People wait to board a evacuaition train from Kyiv to Lviv. Photograph: Ümit Bektaş/Reuters Ukrainian officials claimed nearly 3,000 Russian servicemen had been killed so far, but warned that advance enemy units had already entered the Obolonskyi district of northern Kyiv. The defence ministry advised residents to “prepare molotov cocktails”. The mayor of Kyiv, Vitali Klitschko, said the city had entered “a defensive phase”. He added: “Shots and explosions are ringing out … and saboteurs have already entered Kyiv. The enemy wants to put the capital on its knees and destroy us.” In video footage thought to be from south Ukraine, near Crimea, a Ukrainian civilian was shown standing in front of an advancing Russian military convoy, in scenes reminiscent of Tiananmen Square in 1989, in which a lone Chinese protestor stood in front of a tank, stopping its advance. US officials estimated Russia had launched more than 200 missiles at Ukraine, including both ballistic and cruise weapons. They said most had been aimed at military targets but that some had landed in residential districts, and that it was unclear whether that was accidental or deliberate. The chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Court, Karim Khan, issued a reminder that he had the authority to investigate war crimes inside Ukraine and Amnesty International accused the Russian military of “indiscriminate attacks” after investigating several incidents, including a missile strike on a hospital building in Vuhledar in eastern Ukraine, which killed four civilians and wounded 10 more. A property in Kyiv is heavily damaged from an explosion. Photograph: Maia Mikhaluk/PA In another sign of the war’s potential to spin out of control, two more merchant ships were hit by errant missile strikes in the Black Sea, a Japanese bulk carrier and a Moldovan chemical tanker. Zelenskiy earlier on Friday accused Europe of not being hard or quick enough in sanctioning Russia earlier, urging citizens to compel their governments to do more to stop Putin’s invasion. “Europe has enough strength to stop this aggression,” he said. “You have to act swiftly. We demand effective counteraction to the Russian Federation. Sanctions must be further strengthened.” The Ukrainian government continued its appeals to the EU to step up its sanctions, expressing bitter disappointment that the measures taken so far had not included Russia’s exclusion from the Swift global electronic payments system. The German finance ministry said on Friday that it was open to the proposal of including Swift sanctions, while the US, EU and the UK moved to freeze the foreign-held assets of Putin and his foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov. The US also sanctioned Russian defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, and the chief of the general staff, Valery Gerasimov. The initiative was largely symbolic, as the Russian president is not thought to have identifiable personal wealth abroad. However, the Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman, Maria Zakharova, told a Russian TV station Friday night that relations with the west “have reached the line after which the point of no return begins”. In Kyiv, Zelenskiy said in a televised address that Putin was targeting civilian as well as military sites. “They say that civilian objects are not a target for them. It is a lie; they do not distinguish in which areas to operate,” he said, vowing to continue defending his country and criticising world leaders for “watching from afar”. In Russia, thousands of people defied tough anti-protest legislation to stage anti-war rallies across the country on Thursday night. OVD-Info, which monitors arrests at opposition protests, said more than 1,800 people in 59 cities had been detained. Lt Gen Jim Hockenhull, the UK’s head of defence intelligence, released a statement to reporters about the state of the fighting in Ukraine: “Russian forces continue to advance on two axes towards Kyiv. Their objective is to encircle the capital, to secure control of the population and change the regime..”",0

Uefa moves to end Gazprom deal and strips Russia of Champions League finalRead more  West Ham’s manager David Moyes has given the former Ukraine captain Andriy Yarmolenko time off after the attack on his country, with the winger not in the right frame of mind to play against Wolves on Sunday. “He’s not in a very good position at the moment,” Moyes said. “We’ve given him a few days off. We’ll do all we can to help him – it’s a really difficult time for him and his family. I spoke with him yesterday and he was upset, which you can imagine. We just hope his family keep safe.” Two Ukraine internationals could be involved when Everton host the Premier League leaders. The club has sounded an air-raid siren before its traditional Z-Cars theme as a way of galvanising the Goodison crowd in recent seasons but that is likely to be dropped given the situation in Ukraine.

Several Everton supporters’ groups have produced a banner that features the 22-year-old, his country’s colours and the words “We stand with Ukraine” for Saturday’s game. Frank Lampard says a decision on whether to select Mykolenko against City will be down to the player. “I wouldn’t try to force him into a direction,” the Everton manager said. “The decision will be his. The feeling I get is that by coming here and feeling our support in training, it is a small period where his mind is not on other things. That is what it feels like at the minute and I’ll keep tabs on that day by day. “In terms of us as a club, we’re here to support him in any way we can. He just needs to know we are here for him. How we can help with his family, all we can do at this point is support him. He’s been good, training well. Training is a mini-escape in terms of what is going on in his head. In tough moments it can help a young lad in a tough position. I know there are many others in tougher positions but he has been fine.” Zinchenko, who has captained Ukraine, took part in a vigil outside Manchester Central Library on Thursday along with hundreds of his compatriots. Pep Guardiola said: “What would you do if someone attacked the UK? How would you react? How would you feel? It’s what he feels [to protest]. Unfortunately around the world there are many wars – this is a new one. It’s more than a pity because innocent people are dying when these innocent people just want to live in peace. “He is worried.

Experts said that those reactors, at four power plants around the country, had layers of safeguards to prevent a catastrophic meltdown of their cores, but in a full scale war of the kind Vladimir Putin has unleashed, there was a heightened risk of those safety layers all failing at once.  Radiation spikes were reported on Friday from Chernobyl, the site of the 1986 nuclear disaster which has been overrun by Russian forces. The remains of the reactor core are buried under concrete and the plant is also a storage facility for spent nuclear fuel. 00:49Video appears to show military vehicles at Chernobyl – video The Ukrainian ambassador to Washington Oksana Markarova said that responsibility for the plant, spelt Chornobyl in Ukrainian, now rested with Russia as strict regulations for the plant were not being observed. She accused the Russian forces of holding 92 plant personnel as hostages. Ukraine’s regulatory authority attributed the radiation spikes to military vehicles churning up top soil that is still contaminated by the 1986 reactor explosion. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said the readings from Chernobyl remained low and did not pose a danger to the public, but added that the agency was closely monitoring Ukraine’s reactors. It said the IAEA director general, Rafael Grossi “remained gravely concerned”. Six of Ukraine’s reactors are at a nuclear power plant at Zaporizhzhia, the second biggest in Europe, which is close to where the Russians deployed thousands of troops in amphibious landings on Friday. Up to now the Ukrainian nuclear regulator had assured the IAEA that all its reactors were working safely. However, the Russian advance from the south was fast approaching the area. . While a direct strike on the plant remains a remote possibility, experts warn that a disaster could be caused if staff were abruptly prevented from reaching the facility or if there was a sustained interruption in the power supply required to keep the fuel rods continuously cooled. Nuclear power plants use diesel generators as a backup, but those rely on the supply of fuel, which could be severely limited in the midst of a war. “There are contingencies but I doubt that these power plants have prepared for a full-scale invasion,” said Mariana Budjeryn, a Ukrainian research associate with Harvard University’s project on managing the atom. “In the middle of a large scale conflict, there’s a myriad of things that could happen, for which normal, even very robust, safety procedures at a nuclear power plant [would be insufficient].” The alleged taking of staff as hostages in Chernobyl highlighted the dangers to functioning reactors where operators were essential to shutting them down and keeping them cooled. “There are various different challenges from a staffing perspective. Firstly, can the staff actually get into work without being killed?” said James Acton, co-director of the nuclear policy program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. He added that reserves of diesel for emergency generators became a critical issue in the midst of a war. “Even if you’ve turned the reactor off, you still have a bunch of intensely radioactive fuel that’s generating heat in the core, and so it needs cooling continuously,” Acton said. “Without a grid connection, you’re reliant on whatever fuel or energy you have stored on site, and that is a finite quantity.”",0

Take power into your own hands. It seems that it will be easier for us to come to an agreement than with this gang of drug addicts and neo-Nazis.”  The speech seemed to be ripped from an alternate reality – or from the second world war, where Putin appears to be spending more of his time as he launches the kind of broad military offensive not seen in Europe for nearly 70 years. All this week, Putin’s megalomaniacal tendencies have been on display like never before. He has summoned his aides for a surreal national security council that resembled a television reality show and launched tirades about Lenin and decisions made nearly 100 years ago. He has also, for the first time, spoken about his maximalist goals in this war: regime change in Kyiv, toppling the government of Volodymyr Zelenskiy and replacing it with a more pliant leadership. Putin’s call for a coup in Kyiv indicates that if Russia wins this war, Zelenskiy will almost certainly not remain in power. How he achieves that is anyone’s guess. A number of analysts predicted this as Russia deployed more than 60% of its ground forces to Ukraine’s borders and demanded concessions that could never be granted. But Putin’s unhinged appearances and apparent drive to war have raised questions of whether he remains a rational leader. “Despite Crimea and everything else, Putin had always seemed an extremely pragmatic leader to me,” said Tatyana Stanovaya, the founder of R.Politik. “But now when he’s gone in this war against Ukraine, the logic in the decision is all about emotions, it’s not rational.” What’s going on inside Putin’s mind? His own words give us a disturbing clue | Michel EltchaninoffRead more Those emotions are deeply rooted in history and the historical injustices suffered by Russia. Dmitry Muratov, the editor of Novaya Gazeta, said he saw Putin as a man with “a historical map in his mind and a plan to use his military to achieve it”. Central to that map is Ukraine, which he has described as an artificial state. “Modern Ukraine was wholly and fully created by Russia,” Putin said in a historical sleight-of-hand, “namely Bolshevik, communist Russia.” To help picture it, state TV ran a map earlier this week showing Ukraine cut up to represent which parts were “presents” from various leaders, including Stalin, Lenin and Khrushchev. Some commentators said it represents the partition that Putin himself might be imagining if he gets his way. While once the map may have been viewed as fantasies or media trolling, a western diplomat based in Ukraine on Friday pointed to his speeches and to that map as a serious sign that Putin was weighing up a dismantling of the country. “He is not pretending any more. For the first time I think he’s revealing who he really is,” the diplomat wrote.",0

Kwarteng is understood to have spoken to Looney in the light of Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine, which has increased scrutiny on British business ties to the Kremlin and led to sanctions against Russian firms.  Speaking after the call, a Whitehall source said: “BP left the meeting with no doubt about the strength of the business secretary’s concern about their commercial interest in Russia.” Kwarteng is believed to be uneasy about BP’s 22% stake in Rosneft, the Russian state oil firm, particularly given its role in providing fuel for the military effort in Ukraine. The British oil “supermajor” has been deeply entwined with Russia for years and holds two seats on the 11-strong board of the company. Rosneft is run by Vladimir Putin’s de facto deputy, Igor Sechin, who has been nicknamed Darth Vader due to his fearsome power. The two firms operate a “strategic partnership” that sees them cooperate on research, as well as on oil and gas projects such as Taas-Yuryakh in Eastern Siberia. The arrangement is the legacy of a $55bn deal in 2013 that saw the Moscow-based firm take over BP’s joint venture, TNK-BP. In BP’s most recent set of annual results the state oil company contributed $2.7bn in underlying profit to BP’s bottom line last year, up from just $56m the year before, or just over 21% of its bumper $12.8bn profit for the year. Sources familiar with the situation said Looney and Kwarteng discussed BP’s extensive Russian interests during a call on Friday. While the UK has imposed a range of sanctions on Russian businesses, including the airline Aeroflot and banks Sberbank and VTB, partnerships involving BP and its UK rival Shell have been unaffected. BP boss Bernard Looney and his predecessor, Bob Dudley, both sit on the board of Rosneft, which is chaired by former German chancellor Gerhard Schröder. The relationship has long been mired in controversy: when he was boss of TNK, Dudley fled Russia in 2008 amid fears over his safety and what was described by BP as an “orchestrated campaign of harassment”. BP has already been under fire for soaring profits and dividends amid an intensifying cost of living crisis, as well as pressure to slash emissions and move away from oil and gas exploration. BP declined to comment on discussions with the government.",0

According to Rabobank, the Black Sea region accounts for 34% of global wheat exports, which have been interrupted by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.  At least one cargo vessel carrying food supplies was hit by a missile in Ukrainian waters on Thursday. An agricultural analyst for Rabobank, Dennis Voznesenski, said exports from the region had “ground to a halt” in the short term due to shipping blockages and the high cost or scarcity of insurance for vessels. Australia has virtually zero economic leverage over MoscowRead more Long-term structural changes to wheat flows could also occur if sanctions were implemented on Russian wheat exports. Assuming a full-scale conflict, Rabobank has predicted that Australian wheat prices could rise from the current $367 a tonne to $425 a tonne in the near term. Brett Hosking, the chair of Grain Growers Australia, told Guardian Australia: “First and foremost, when we talk about Ukraine, our hearts and thoughts and prayers go out to the Ukrainian people, and in particular the Ukrainian farmers who at the end of the day are family farmers exactly like we have here in Australia. “To see that happen to our colleagues is quite devastating, but we do have the opportunity to make sure those markets are still supplied with grain should any disruptions occur,” he said. According to Hosking, the biggest limiting factor was Australia’s supply chain. “We physically have the grain in Australia on the back of a really good harvest, but making sure we can execute it out of the country is the next challenge.” ‘It’s a catch-22’ An agricultural market analyst with Thomas Elder Markets, Andrew Whitelaw, agreed the main issue was logistics, as there were “only so many trains and trucks to load to get grain to port”. He said there were “opportunities for more export markets but it’s a catch-22, so we have to be able to get it out”. According to Whitelaw, Australia’s exporting facilities were already at capacity. Sign up to receive Guardian Australia’s fortnightly Rural Network email newsletter Sign up for the Rural Network email newsletter He said constrained capacity to export huge volumes – as well as the large crop itself – had seen Australia’s wheat market unable to keep up with the “huge rise” the global wheat market had experienced. Whitelaw said global grain prices were strong at the start of the year, but since 18 February they had jumped from A$408 a tonne to A$475 a tonne. He was concerned the high rate resulting from one humanitarian crisis could lead to another. How can Australians help the people of Ukraine?Read more Countries in the Middle East and Africa were already experiencing rampant food inflation, he said, which could be exacerbated by the flow-on effects of conflict in Ukraine and the driving up of grain prices. “Places like Egypt and Algeria rely on bread as primary foodstuffs,” he said. “It’s going to be tough for them because food price is directly correlated with price of wheat.” He said the impact on the grain market would depend on the length and severity of the Ukraine crisis. “Everything takes second fiddle to what’s happening in Russia,” Whitelaw said. Whitelaw, like Hosking, was also concerned for his Ukrainian colleagues in the grains industry, two of whom he interviewed live as part of his Ag Watchers podcast. Agricultural production will go on Ben Lyons, the director of the Rural Economies Centre of Excellence at the University of Southern Queensland, believes there has been a short-term response to the situation in Ukraine but that the medium to longer term effect on global wheat markets will not be as significant. According to Lyons, even in the worst case scenario for Ukraine – that a Russian takeover occurs – agricultural production will go on. “It doesn’t stop things growing,” he said. Recent crop failures in the US and the Black Sea region had been more severe in terms of disruption to the grain market, he said. This had driven customers to find markets elsewhere, like Australia. “You can overstate the impacts,” Lyons said. “There’s definitely short-term behavioural [reactions from] everyone in the grain trading game.” Sign up for the Rural Network email newsletter

Morrison was flanked by Bridget Archer, the moderate Liberal, who has made a name for herself in Canberra by (wait for it) saying what she thinks and doing what she believes is right. A journalist asked the prime minister whether he continued to support her. If this seems like a strange question, let’s contextualise quickly. Australia has virtually zero economic leverage over MoscowRead more Archer was one of five MPs who torpedoed Morrison’s signature religious discrimination bill in part because the package failed to protect transgender children in religious schools. Before that, Archer also worked with the independent Helen Haines to bring on an unscheduled debate about a federal integrity commission – the anti-corruption body Morrison promised voters but failed to deliver. She’s capital-T trouble, in other words. But Morrison was having none of this naysaying. “You know, we love Bridge,” he enthused. “We really do. And I’m really pleased she’s on my team, and she’s on my team and she’s a fiery member of my team and she’s a fiery member for Bass.” But before anyone could grab a fire extinguisher, or order an “I heart Bridge” campaign T-shirt, there was a plot twist. Still in Tasmania, Morrison went on to endorse a private senator’s bill being spearheaded by Claire Chandler. Chandler, a conservative, is Archer’s Tasmanian colleague. Chandler’s bill would allow sporting groups to exclude transgender people from single-sex sports. Sporting codes seem either bemused or openly hostile towards this proposal. Chandler says she pursued it to save women’s sport, and because Tasmanian parents want it. If we track back to Archer and the religious discrimination proposal, she crossed the floor in an effort to protect and support trans kids because she knows they are a vulnerable cohort. She didn’t do it to be liked, or to be thanked. Archer did it because if you believe God is love, you really can’t stomach doing anything else. She told parliament she feared doing anything other than what she did would “risk lives”. In the days following her decision, there’s been gratitude. But there’s also been hostility. So Morrison’s effusive on-ground endorsement of the Chandler proposal looked pretty pointed. Almost like a prime minister’s love of “Bridge” might be a teensy bit conditional. In any case, the personalities don’t matter as much as the signal. Morrison at the moment is like a truffle-hunting dog, sniffing out his path to election victory. He has spent this past week hot on the trail of two wars: one lethal, the other cultural. Obviously, the lethal conflict is the horror playing out in Ukraine. We’ll get to that war, and its local political implications, shortly. But first, let’s consider Morrison’s experimental culture war: a war on wokeness improvised during a campaign stop in Tasmania. The Coalition’s push for a single-sex sport law isn’t about sport or even politics – only cruelty | Van BadhamRead more Ever since his religious discrimination legislation hit the fence, Morrison has been throwing red meat to the right of his party. The prime minister has to do this, because safeguarding religious freedom was what conservatives (including the prime minister himself) wanted in return for the legalisation of same-sex marriage. Morrison failed to deliver. As losses go, this was a bad one. Morrison rolled out of the setback by launching a sonic boom on China. He would be more Dutton than Peter Dutton, which, let’s be honest, takes some doing. Then, more protein for conservatives the following week. This full-throated endorsement of the Chandler bill. It was a “terrific” proposal. “Claire is a champion for women’s sport and I think she’s been right to raise these issues in the way that she has,” Morrison said. “Well done, Claire.” Morrison is singularly focused shoring up his own position – and apparently reckless enough to lurch from reds under the bed to casual transphobia to land that objective. But his project is bigger than holding out any last-minute regicidal brain explosion by raging rightwingers during budget week. Morrison is very plainly on the hunt for disaffected but highly motivated voters. Perhaps it’s simplest to think of Morrison’s tactics this way. If the 2019 election was about him whispering sweet nothings in the ears of “quiet Australians”, the 2022 contest is about the prime minister picking up a loud hailer so he can be heard by the noisy folks. He’s courting a noisy, minority of voters alienated from the major parties, from government as a construct, and in some cases, from rapidly shifting societal and cultural norms. People in politics report there is a cohort of Australians right now who are riled, and emotional. Call that the legacy of the pandemic. While Australian society has moved a measurable distance in favour of inclusion and tolerance, MPs say constituents uncomfortable with the idea of people transitioning are energised and motivated by their discomfort. For some – often people who have had no lived experience of loved ones in crisis – the whole trans conversation is the practical manifestation of cultural relativism and progressivism gone mad. When hackles are raised you get othering. Tribalism. Shunning and shaming. We see similar raised hackles in the public protests against vaccination mandates – this existential sense that powerful forces have shifted a known centre of gravity in an unfavourable direction. Morrison thinks he needs to engage that cohort of voters because he can’t trust that preferences from disaffected rightwingers will flow back to the Coalition on election night. Now we need to think about Ukraine. Australians have been watching the dead-eyed Vladimir Putin creeping towards lethal aggression for some weeks now. Russia’s escalation on Thursday wasn’t a shock, but it is one thing to understand intellectually that something bad can happen and another thing to watch an invasion of another country happen on live television. It would be an understatement to say the times are deeply disconcerting. Essential poll analysis:​ Coalition’s national security scare campaign may have backfiredRead more The events of this past week lay the foundations of Morrison’s khaki election. The prime minister very obviously believes the Coalition can prosper politically in this uncertainty. But to do that, Morrison has to bring that sense of threat, or dread, back home. If you watch what the prime minister is saying, you’ll already have worked out how he’s doing that. The bridge between Ukraine and Australia is China. His political messaging is happening at two levels. The big picture Morrison is painting is if Putin can do this – ignore the sovereignty of a peaceful neighbour and grab what he wants – so can the regime in Beijing. This could happen in our neighbourhood is the point. Morrison is speaking about China almost as much as he’s speaking about Ukraine at the moment. Why won’t China condemn Putin? Why is China at odds with the west? Why is China easing trade with Russia? What is China hiding? All very reasonable questions, of course. But this post-invasion posture from Morrison is also part two of the China frenzy from the week before – the wild talk of Manchurian candidates, and Anthony Albanese being Xi’s candidate to win in May. Morrison’s political objectives are blindingly obvious. What is less clear is whether his current tin hat foray can cancel out the accumulated domestic disaffection of the past 12 months. Is come to daddy an automatic vote winner for the Coalition in 2022? Our latest Guardian Essential poll suggests voters are inclined to see complexity where Morrison is intent on packaging aggressive simplicity. Morrison spent last week telling voters China was bad, and bad China wants Labor to win. Voters responded by telling the pollsters at Essential that Australia’s relationship with China was complex. Disapproval of the prime minister also ticked up, suggesting voters are now sceptical about Morrison and his relentless shtick. But that survey was taken before Russia stormed over the Ukrainian border. When it comes to fighting Australian elections in the shadow of war, or substantial geopolitical realignments, or security threats, I can tell you what recent history shows us. But I can’t yet tell you how this story ends.",0

Jens Stoltenberg, the Nato secretary general, chaired a virtual summit of 30 leaders on Friday, where the agreement was made to amass forces in eastern Europe.  “No one should be fooled by the Russian government’s barrage of lies,” the leaders said in a joint statement. “We are now making significant additional defensive deployments of forces to the eastern part of the alliance.” EU and UK announce sanctions targeting Vladimir Putin and Sergei LavrovRead more Stoltenberg said Russia’s invasion was “the gravest threat to Euro-Atlantic security in decades”. “Russia has shattered peace in Europe. The people of Ukraine are fighting for their freedom in the face of Russia’s unprovoked invasion. We deplore the tragic loss of life, enormous human suffering and destruction.” James Heappey, a UK defence minister, earlier said the UK would send further armed forces to Estonia “earlier than planned” to reinforce the Nato ally. The Royal Welsh battlegroup will be arriving in the country to double force levels. Heappey also revealed that a total of 1,000 UK troops were on standby to support Ukraine’s neighbours with refugee responses. “The 1,000 troops that are on standby are there to support Hungary, Slovakia, Romania and Poland with the expected humanitarian challenges that they will face as people make their way out of Ukraine,” he said. However, Heappey also warned against any potential meeting between Russian and Nato troops, saying it could become “existential”. Speaking in parliament, he said: “We must all in this house be clear that British and Nato troops should not, must not, play an active role in Ukraine. We must all be clear what the risk of miscalculation could be and how existential that could very quickly become if people miscalculate and things escalate unnecessarily.” During the debate, Heappey was pressed by MPs to support a no-fly zone across Ukraine, which he rejected because of the risk of Nato forces encountering Russian ones. In an earlier exchange on BBC’s Radio 4 Today programme, the Ukrainian MP Lesia Vasylenko pleaded with Ben Wallace, the defence secretary, for the UK and the US to close airspace above Ukraine “in order for these casualties not to escalate”. However, Wallace said this would constitute a direct act of aggression towards Russia, which would prompt a response and result in “war across Europe”, as any attack on the UK would implicate all other Nato members. Wallace said: “To do a no-fly zone I would have to put British fighter jets against Russian; Nato would have to declare war on Russia.” He added: “I cannot and won’t trigger a European war but I will help Ukraine fight every street with every piece of equipment we can support them.” Wallace said the UK had supported accelerating Ukraine’s Nato membership, which would have triggered military intervention from fellow members, but that other countries had been concerned by the pace. He added that other democratic countries had a “moral duty” to continue to arm the Ukrainian forces since it was widely acknowledged that Putin “won’t stop at Ukraine” and would proceed to train his sights on Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, as he “doesn’t believe the Baltic states are countries”.He told Sky News: “What you’re seeing on your cameras today is illogical. Putin didn’t need to do this, he didn’t need to occupy a sovereign country. None of the reasons why he would do that stack up. He’s not doing something that’s logical, he’s doing something about his ego and his legacy.” As the EU and UK decided to bring in sanctions against Vladmir Putin, the Russian president, and his foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, Boris Johnson and allies from the Joint Expeditionary Force alliance including Sweden, Norway and the Netherlands agreed on the need to go further after a meeting on Thursday morning. Downing Street said the leaders “agreed that more sanctions were needed, including focusing on President Putin’s inner circle, building on the measures that had already been agreed”. It said Johnson had made clear to Nato allies that the UK “stood ready for any further request from Nato’s supreme allied commander Europe to go further with military support to Nato from UK armed forces”. Keir Starmer, the Labour leader, has said he believes “further financial restrictions” against Russia are needed. He said if Johnson brought forward tougher sanctions on Russia, they would be voted through parliament “very, very quickly” with Labour’s support. Liz Truss, the foreign secretary, briefed MPs on the prospect of further sanctions next week and also summoned the Belarus ambassador to London, Maxim Yermalovich, to the Foreign Office. He was told members of its ruling elite would be sanctioned as a result of their role in facilitating the invasion of Ukraine by Russian forces. James Cleverly, the Europe minister, said afterwards: “The UK condemns the role Belarus is playing in the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Belarus must stop supporting Russia’s illegal and unprovoked actions.”",0

Day two fighting  Kyiv Russian forces entered the outskirts of Kyiv on Friday and were threatening the Ukrainian capital from the north-west and east in a lightning attack apparently aimed at seizing the city. Late on Friday witnesses reported hearing artillery rounds and intense gunfire from the western part of Kyiv, as president Volodymyr Zelenskiy warned his citizens: “This night will be the hardest... We must withstand. The night will be very hard, but sunset will come.” He added: “We can’t lose the capital.” Kyiv map The defence ministry in Moscow claimed its forces had taken control of the strategic Hostomel airfield to the north-west after a day of fighting, although Western sources said they did not believe the airport was usable. A jittery mood also contributed to confusion: what were thought to be a Russian tank were filmed by locals in the Obolonskyi district about six miles north of the city centre in the morning – although one expert said it was probably a Ukranian Strela-10 air defence system. Armoured vehicle in Kyiv Nevertheless such was the nervousness, Kyiv authorities earlier warned locals in Obolonskyi to stay off the streets because “active hostilities” were approaching . Residents were urged to “make molotov cocktails”. The defence ministry also said it had distributed 18,000 assault rifles in the capital. Gunfire could be also heard close to St Sophia Cathedral, reporters said, creating an increasingly tense atmosphere in the capital, which many expected would have been better defended given its obvious strategic significance. Intense gunfire broke out on a bridge across the Dnieper River dividing eastern and western Kyiv, with about 200 Ukrainian forces taking defensive positions and sheltering behind their armoured vehicles and under the bridge. Another key bridge leading to the capital was blown away, with smoke rising from it. Ukrainian soldiers take position on a bridge over the Dnieper in Kyiv. Photograph: Emilio Morenatti/AP Konrad Muzyka, the president of Rochan Consulting, said the “situation does look dire at the moment” particularly regarding Kyiv. “It appears that the main goal is to take Kyiv, break the C2 [command and control], and ‘decapitate’ the political leadership.” Russian forces have been trying to advance through the north-western suburbs around Vorzel, Buch and Irpen. In the early afternoon, Russia claimed it had control of the capital from the west. During the fighting, Ukrainian officials claimed that a kindergarten in Vorzel where 50 children were sheltering was hit by Russian fire, although without inflicting any casualties.

Photograph: Anadolu Agency/Getty Images Ukraine’s military also warned that a group of Russian spies and saboteurs was seen in a district about 3 miles (5km) north of the city centre. Video posted online by an interior ministry adviser apparently showed dead Russian saboteurs who had captured Ukrainian military vehicles and switched uniforms. Windows were blasted out of a 10-storey apartment block near Kyiv’s main airport, where a 2-metre crater filled with rubble showed where a shell had struck before dawn. A police officer said people were injured there but not killed. Approach to Kyiv Pressure was also intensifying around Chernihiv, about 90 miles north-east of Kyiv, Ukraine’s military said. Russian forces are trying to bypass the city, where there had been fighting, and head down the E95 road to Kozelec and ultimately Kyiv’s eastern suburbs. Farther east, about 125 miles from the capital, Ukraine’s military admitted on Friday morning that the city of Konotop had been lost to Russian forces. Boryspil, the capital’s main civilian airport, lies to the east of the capital. The speed of the Russian advance, despite the best efforts of Ukraine’s military, caught many by surprise as Russian military forces converged on Kyiv from the north, east and west. But British defence intelligence said it believed the majority of Russian forces aiming for Kyiv were over 50km away. four fronts Mariupol and the Donbas The US department of defence said that Russia had launched an amphibious landing with thousands of naval infantry to the west of the key southern coastal city of Mariupol. “It certainly appears to us to be a piece of their designs in the south to further cut off the Donbas region and to – from a southern perspective – continue to try to take population centres,” said John Kirby, the Pentagon press secretary. Kirby said that the US did not have “perfect visibility” on the attack, but video posted on social media earlier appeared to show a column of Russian armoured vehicles, including T-72B3 tanks and BMP-3 armoured vehicles, moving through the coastal town of Prymorsk which is located between Melitopol and Mariupol. Describing the “amphibious assault” under way from the Sea of Azov a senior US defence official told reporters that Russians are “putting potentially thousands of naval infantry ashore there … The general assumption is they are going to move towards the north-east, towards Mariupol and the Donbas region.” Several social media accounts in the region showed images and accounts of volleys of Russian Grad missiles hitting targets near Mariupol late on Friday afternoon. The aim of the landing would appear to be to allow Russian marines to link up with forces farther east in the Donbas region, where Ukraine’s forces were believed to be holding firm.

South-east of Sumy the city of Kharkiv, which has a population of more than 1 million, is gradually being surrounded. There were reports of artillery fire and shelling in and around the city. A resident in the southern Black Sea port of Odesa said that while there had been Russian strikes in the south of the city the north remained calm. It appears not to be an early target. Casualties Ukraine said that it had killed 1,000 Russian soldiers on Friday alone – and eliminated up to 80 tanks, 7 helicopters and 10 planes. Moscow has given no casualty count.

With the UN refugee agency warning that as many as 5 million Ukrainians could be forced to flee, the Liberal Democrats called for a comprehensive and fully funded refugee scheme. Mark Drakeford, the Labour Welsh first minister, said he wanted his country to be a “nation of sanctuary”.  Dozens of refugee charities have jointly called for an evacuation and resettlement plan similar to the one that housed thousands of families in the UK after the Balkans conflicts in the 1990s. However, asked whether it planned to take any Ukrainian refugees, Downing Street said it was instead “working incredibly closely with Ukraine’s neighbours” to support them in coping with Ukrainians fleeing the country, and 350 extra UK troops were in Poland assisting. Foreign Office teams have been sent to countries including Hungary, Romania, Slovakia and Moldova to help with immigration efforts, primarily for UK nationals, now British staff have been withdrawn from its embassy in Ukraine, but can also assist other nationalities. In a letter to Liz Truss, the foreign secretary, and Priti Patel, the home secretary, the Lib Dems called for a full resettlement scheme, including a five-year funding package for councils that take Ukrainian nationals. Drakeford said he had discussed the likelihood of large numbers of refugees being pushed across Europe, adding: “We have an ambition in Wales to be a nation of sanctuary.” Ukraine’s neighbours bracing for millions of refugees if Russia invadesRead more In contrast, the shadow home secretary, Yvette Cooper, said the UK should help refugees find assistance in countries neighbouring Ukraine. She also called for efforts to ensure Ukrainians with family members in the UK could join them. The Home Office has already said that Ukrainians in the UK on temporary visas can extend them or switch to another type of visa while still in the country. Caroline Coombs, from the campaign group Reunite Families UK, said the package of measures did not go far enough. She said: “The Home Office has provided emergency visas for family members of British citizens, which has at least given some British citizens and their families the chance to get out, but with the visa application centre in Kyiv and the airspace now closed we’re concerned about how this all plays out for those still left in the country and who urgently need to get across borders.” “Under normal circumstances, the UK spouse visa rules are very harsh and a minefield for people to navigate,” Coombs added. “If they were more humane and fair in the first place, many more British citizens and their families could have safely been back in the UK already.” Colin Yeo, an immigration lawyer, said that while the concessions were “useful”, there was more the government could do to help those fleeing the Russian attacks. “The nationality and borders bill the government is pushing through parliament right now will criminalise any Ukrainians seeking refuge here and there are already huge backlogs in the asylum system, which have more than doubled during Priti Patel’s tenure as home secretary.” Alex Piletska, an immigration lawyer, said that the concession “clearly does not go far enough and excludes, in particular, elderly relatives of British citizens. The Home Office should update its policy or risk stranding British citizens in a war zone.” A Home Office spokesperson said: “The government’s priority remains supporting British nationals and their families who want to leave Ukraine. We are working around the clock to process visa applications.”",0

The initial Russian offensive began on three fronts on Thursday to the sound of a missile barrage. The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, sent tanks to pound Ukraine’s cities. His warships attacked from the sea. Innocent civilians are being killed, their homes reduced to rubble. With Russian forces closing on Ukraine’s capital, Kyiv, and the government asking its three million people to take up arms, Mr Putin’s war “to stop genocide” may promote one. Mr Putin is acting like a thug. He is threatening the international system by taking what he wants, irrespective of the human cost. A humanitarian crisis looms as tens of thousands of refugees cross into eastern Europe. The images beamed from the streets of Ukraine have rekindled memories of the wars of the 20th century – of a kind that once seemed unimaginable in 2022. Many have been left to wonder: is this a new cold war? Or the beginning of a third world war? Of the two, the former is unwanted but preferable to a global conflagration.  This explains why Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s pleas for help from the west have gone unanswered. Mr Zelenskiy may get more weapons. There is also diplomatic condemnation against Russian aggression. But Ukraine will not receive any military assistance – such as a Nato-enforced no–fly zone – that would shift the odds decisively in Ukraine’s favour. Mr Putin’s threat to those who try to intervene with nuclear retaliation is dangerous and reckless. Only someone prepared for a war of extinction would utter such a warning. Western nations have decided, for the moment, that tough sanctions would hurt them more than they would hurt Russia. In the 24 hours after Mr Putin signed a decree recognising two breakaway Ukrainian territories, the Bloomberg financial news service calculated that the EU, the UK and the US spent $600m on Russian oil and gas products. This would explain why the west’s sanctions package against Moscow’s banks is designed to allow energy payments to continue. But the dependence on Moscow is unsustainable – as is a wider economic war of attrition. Instead, the west, and Europe in particular, must start managing without Russian gas by ramping up supplies of greener sources of energy. Russia’s determination to impose a military solution to the political problem of Ukraine is a criminal mistake resting on a might-is-right argument. Russian officials claim to be open to talks, but Mr Putin’s description of the Ukrainian government as “a band of drug addicts and neo-Nazis” shows Moscow is not serious. The world is sliding into a protracted international struggle for spheres of influence between great powers. A Ukrainian defeat would see Washington pivot to a Europe where potentially Russia and the US see each other as enemies. Yet hostilities would have to remain below a certain threshold. Even if Mr Putin achieves quick success, parts of the Ukrainian military that are not defeated are likely to continue fighting – raising the prospect of grinding guerrilla warfare against Russian occupation or a puppet government. Mr Putin’s primary goal is for Ukraine never to join Nato. His other demand would limit Ukrainian sovereignty so that the country would be firmly in Moscow’s grip. Without compromise, the Russian president will isolate himself and his country from the European continent. Ukraine’s people should be able to choose their governments and these ought to be able to face both east and west without hostility. Mr Putin’s war is putting paid to this, which is a tragedy of immense proportions. But history does not end when victory is declared. Wars are never won forever.",0

The initiative is largely symbolic, as the Russian president is unlikely to have identifiable personal wealth abroad, but the move followed recognition that appeals for action from Volodymyr Zelenskiy had to be heard.  The sanctions were closely coordinated. Two hours into a meeting of foreign ministers, the Latvian representative, Edgars Rinkēvičs, tweeted that the bloc had formally “adopted the 2nd sanctions package”. Rinkēvičs added that “the asset freeze includes president of Russia and its foreign minister”. Soon afterwards, a spokesperson for Downing Street said the UK government would also act against the Russian leadership. Boris Johnson told a Nato summit that it was a necessary response to the Kremlin’s “revanchist mission”.

There are people who will take care of that.” Later on Friday, the White House announced similar measures against Putin and Lavrov, saying that the move had been made in coordination with European allies. Russian foreign ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova brushed off the measures, saying: “Neither Putin nor Lavrov have accounts in Britain or anywhere abroad.” But, speaking on Russian television, she said that “we have reached the line after which the point of no return begins.” Putin and Lavrov, who has been foreign minister since 2004, will not face travel bans as the EU and UK wish to maintain a diplomatic way through the crisis but the western allies wanted to show their resolve. Zelenskiy had told EU leaders during a virtual appearance at their summit on Thursday night, as Russian forces encircled the Ukrainian capital, that it may be the last time they would see him. On Friday, he urged European citizens to compel their governments to do more to stop Putin in his tracks. Zelenskiy said: “Europe has enough strength to stop this aggression. You still can stop this aggression. You have to act swiftly. We demand effective counteraction to the Russian Federation. Sanctions must be further strengthened.” EU leaders at a summit in Brussels had agreed in principle in the early hours of Friday to impose a second tranche of measures designed to cripple the Russian economy in the medium to long-term with more banks, state-owned companies and individuals to be targeted, along with key sectors of the Russian economy.

Neither has the EU followed the UK in banning Aeroflot from its airspace for fear that Russia will retaliate by blocking European carriers from flying over Russia to Asian destinations. The sale of Belgian diamonds or Italian luxury goods to Russia will also be exempted from export controls. Late on Friday the UK extended its flight ban to include Russian private jets. Germany’s finance minister, Christian Lindner, said on Friday that his government, which has been cautious, was “open” to cutting Russia from Swift, adding: “But you have to know what you’re doing.” An official in Brussels said EU governments needed to decide just how valuable the bloc’s €80bn annual trade with Russia was to them. As it stands, less than half of that trade will be affected at all by the EU’s sanctions regime. Cutting Russia off from Swift and following the US and UK on correspondent banking would strangle it. “If I have 80bn [euros] of trade and I’m dependent on energy in particular, then I have to think for a second,” the EU official said. “I mean, [Swift] is still on the table.” 01:02'We are defending our country alone,' Zelenskiy tells Ukrainians as Russia approaches Kyiv – video When asked why Swift had not been included in the punitive measures, Jean-Yves Le Drian, France’s foreign minster, said it had been “because we had to move quickly”. But the minister added: “There will be other penalties [to come].” Charles Michel, the European Council president, spoke to Zelenskiy to reassure him that a third package of sanctions was being drawn up. Boris Johnson has voiced his support for cutting Russia from Swift and Ireland’s taoiseach, Micheál Martin, said his government was in favour. Martin said: “People have different perspectives on the efficacy or value of Swift in itself, so I don’t think we should singularly focus on Swift because the sanctions will hit hard at the industrial base, in terms of areas that will hurt the Russian economy.” But he added: “Having said that, we pushed and will continue to push for the broadest possible sanctions. So, yes, the Irish government has no difficulty whatsoever with the Swift system being sanctioned, and that’s something that we would support.” Under the EU’s new sanctions, all members of the Duma, the Russian security council will be subject to travel bans and asset freezes along with any Belarusian officials in the military and ministry of defence who “facilitated” the invasion of Ukraine. There is also a proposal to enlarge the listing criteria for imposing sanctions on individuals as well to “better capture other forms of support to the regime, including oligarchs”. Two additional banks, Alfa bank and Otkritie, will be subject to sanctions and there will be a prohibition on EU financial service providers lending to eight state-owned companies, ranging from the owners of seaports to automobile manufacturers. There will be a prohibition on new bank deposits of more than €100,000 by Russian nationals and there will be a ban on the sale of all aircraft, spare parts and equipment to Russian airlines. The EU will also limit Russia’s access to crucial technology such as semiconductors and components needed to modernise its oil refinery sector. The Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, declined to comment on possible punitive measures against Putin. He said Russia had deliberately reduced its dependence on foreign imports to protect itself against sanctions. He said: “The main goal … was to ensure complete self-sufficiency and complete import substitution if necessary. To a large extent this goal has been achieved. Undoubtedly there will be problems, but they will not be insurmountable.”",0

The FTSE 100 closed up 3.9%, rebounding from an almost 4% drop the previous day after Moscow invaded Ukraine, but still ending the week in the red.  Similar rises were seen on France and Germany’s exchanges, while the Russian stock market, which fell 33% on Thursday, ended Friday up 20%. The FTSE 250 index ticked up by 3.2% and, in the US, the benchmark S&P 500 gained in early trading. The FTSE 100’s rebound was propelled by investors’ response to sanctions imposed on Russia, which were less stringent than many expected, and an influx of bargain-hunters buying the dip. “It’s quite an impressive rebound,” said Seema Shah, the chief global strategist at Principal Global Investors. “The market is responding to the idea that sanctions at this stage are not interrupting energy supply.” Prices for a barrel of Brent crude – the international benchmark for oil – dropped below $94 on Friday from highs on Thursday of over $101, making many investors fear a prolonged rise in energy prices. Meanwhile, UK petrol prices on Thursday hit a record high of almost 150p a litre, with further rises expected. The average price of unleaded petrol climbed to 149.67p and diesel rose to 153.05p on Thursday, according to RAC data from roughly 7,500 UK petrol forecourts – both record highs. Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk The petrol price jump is a further burden for the UK public amid an already crushing cost-of-living crisis, with inflation at 5.5% in January – its highest rate for almost 30 years. “Sadly, more increases are on the way,” said Simon Williams, RAC’s fuel spokesperson, who expects the price to vault 150p a litre “early next week”. “This is the worst possible combination for drivers as it will push already rising prices higher still and worsen the cost-of-living crisis,” Williams said. Despite Friday’s gains, market volatility looked set to thunder on, Shah said, driven by uncertainty about Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. “It’s very difficult with any geopolitical crisis, but particularly with this one, to understand how it’s going to play out or how long it’s going to go on for,” she said. “So for anyone to call yesterday the bottom, I think it’s a bit premature.”",0

Dozens of homes were scorched or shredded, their inhabitants turned into some of Kyiv’s first war refugees. In one apartment block 10 floors of kitchens, living rooms and bedrooms sat open to the skies, their balconies, doors and windows broken off or shattered into pieces by the weapon that brought the Russian invasion to this corner of the city.  A heavily damaged apartment complex in Kyiv. Photograph: Anton Skyba/Anton Skyba/Globe and Mail The missile hit soon after 4am on Friday, before Russian troops reached the city outskirts, or Ukrainian troops set up defensive positions in its historic centre. “People are grieving. This is already a tragedy,” said Gorban Abasov, a 70-year-old singer. Most of the people who lived there were pensioners like him, he said, none had army links and nearby buildings were civilian as well. There was no reason for such a lethal weapon to land here, but none of those gathered to inspect the damage seemed surprised that civilians were already in the line of fire, even before the battle for Kyiv had really begun. After all, there was no reason for Russian troops to be in their country, beyond the terrifying whim of an ageing autocrat. As Abasov stared at the ruins of his home, Ukrainian soldiers were already taking up position in Kyiv’s historic centre and its strategic bridges across the Dnieper and fighting advance Russian forces on its outskirts. While it is not yet clear what future Vladimir Putin envisages for Ukraine if his invasion succeeds, it is clear he wants to hold the capital and dismantle the government of Volodymyr Zelenskiy, which he attacked on Friday as a “gang of drug addicts and neo-Nazis”. Zelenskiy, who is Jewish, has vowed to stay in the city to fight for it, despite offers of evacuation. On Friday evening he posted a video, filmed on the streets of the capital, showing him in military fatigues and standing with the prime minister and other key political leaders, proving he had not fled. “All of us here. We are defending our independence. And we will continue to do so. Glory to our male and female defenders. Glory to Ukraine.” Zelensky posts a video with top aides + his prime minister, apparently from above ground in Kyiv. “We are all here, our soldiers are here … we are defending our independence” pic.twitter.com/CX7s7Rq0ED— Felix Light (@felix_light) February 25, 2022 The ex-president Petro Poroshenko, once a political rival and now an ally against Russian aggression, also held a gun during a live television interview from the streets of the capital. City authorities had urged residents to stay home but prepare molotov cocktails for a citizen uprising against Russian fighters if they broke through defensive lines. In one district they handed out rifles to any citizen who wanted to fight and the defence ministry opened the army to any Ukrainian citizen. “Bring only your passport and social security number. There are no age restrictions,” the ministry said in a public post. The invitation to fight was taken up by so many Ukrainians of all ages and backgrounds that the recruiting office was overwhelmed. “They told us: ‘Come back tomorrow morning, we haven’t even eaten all day, have mercy on us,’” said Sergey, an Oxford-educated civil servant who tried to join the city defence force on Friday morning. Ukrainian service members in armoured personal carriers in the capital. Photograph: Valentyn Ogirenko/Reuters The night before, Kyiv had been rife with rumours of an all-out assault to seize control of the streets and government buildings, capture or kill officials, and make way for a puppet government, fuelled by tweets from the US senator Marco Rubio. Many Kyivites spent the night in metro stations or bomb shelters because of these warnings, perhaps one reason why the missile strike caused so much damage but injured only four people. It was one of a series of blasts that shook the city awake soon after 4am; another was caused by a Russian plane that crashed into residential buildings. The wail of air raid warning sirens followed soon after, calling those not already underground to take shelter. The city’s mayor, the former world heavyweight boxing champion Vitali Klitschko, said the city was in a “defence phase” and warned of undercover Russian “sabotage groups” in a briefing on Friday, but the assault had already got much further than that. Ukrainian soldiers at Kyiv central train station. Photograph: Ümit Bektaş/Reuters There were gunfights reported in northern Obolonskyi district and photos circulated of soldiers readying to defend Podil, a riverside port district that is home to a historic university and crammed with fashionable bars and restaurants that make it Kyiv’s answer to Brooklyn in New York or Shoreditch in London. The days-long fight for control of Hostomel airport on the city outskirts, which has a long runway that would allow Russia to land heavy transport planes, intensified. Elsewhere, in parts of the city where the war had not quite arrived, the streets were eerily empty, apart from long but calm queues outside pharmacies and supermarkets, as a remarkably stoic population stocked up for a possible siege. The city council asked citizens to stop livestreaming the streets and avoid posting pictures of soldiers and army positions, in case it aided Russian troops. Only the roads leading westward to relative safety were still crammed, as a last surge of refugees tried to escape the coming bloodshed. The caravan of cars, most packed with people, pets and possessions, often came to a complete halt as roads were overwhelmed by the flood of exiles. 01:46'I don't want to leave': Ukrainians record messages from their cars as they flee war – video The railway station was also swamped with crowds desperate to escape. Guards fired warning shots at one point to prevent a stampede among hundreds of people who stormed carriages as they pulled in. Those who stayed took heart from news of Ukrainian forces’ success in many battles around the country, which apparently slowed plans to encircle Kyiv. British authorities said on Friday that most Russian troops were still more than 50km (30 miles) from the capital, and had opened a new advance towards Kyiv having failed to capture the city of Chernihiv, which they had hoped to use as a staging post.

Another showed a woman shouting abuse at soldiers and telling them to put sunflower seeds in their pockets, so when they were killed on Ukrainian soil, flowers would grow from their corpses. But for all the mood of defiance, there was also a resignation to bloodshed ahead, in an all-out fight against an enemy whose tactics in other wars have included targeting civilians. Anatoly Grigovivch, 64, had defied the air raid sirens to race over to his daughter’s legal firm, which had been torn apart by the missile that exploded next to the apartment block. He was worried about looters.

23,"Friday, 25 February 2022",2022-02-25,Russia partially restricts access to Facebook to ‘protect Russian media’,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/24/ukraine-hackers-defend-against-russia,,"Russian authorities have announced the “partial restriction” of access to Facebook after the social media network limited the accounts of several Kremlin-backed media organisations after Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine. The state communications watchdog, Roskomnadzor, demanded that Facebook lift restrictions it said the company had placed on state news agency RIA Novosti, state TV channel Zvezda, and pro-Kremlin news sites Lenta.ru and Gazeta.ru. The restrictions placed by Facebook on the sites included marking their content as unreliable, Roskomnadzor said.  The watchdog said its “partial restriction” of Facebook would take effect on Friday, but did not clarify what measures would be implemented. Roskomnadzor described its move as “measures to protect Russian media”. It said Russia’s foreign ministry and the prosecutor general’s office found Facebook “complicit in violation of fundamental human rights and freedoms, as well as the rights and freedoms of Russian nationals”. Facebook’s owner, Meta, did not comment. Nick Clegg, Meta’s president of global affairs, announced on Friday morning that the company had established a “special operations centre” to deal with Ukraine-linked content that incited violence or used hate speech. He later acknowledged in a tweet that Russia had restricted Facebook after it refused to “stop the independent factchecking and labelling of content posted on Facebook by four Russian state-owned media organisations”. “Ordinary Russians are using our apps to express themselves and organise for actions,” he said. “We want them to continue to make their voices heard.” The situation in Ukraine is devastating. Our teams at Meta have implemented a number of measures to keep our platforms and our users in the region as safe as we can. This is a fast moving situation and our teams remain on high alert. pic.twitter.com/8wFgx7muKG— Nick Clegg (@nickclegg) February 25, 2022 Meanwhile, Russia Today, the state-backed news service, confirmed its website had been hit by a cyber-attack after a Twitter account linked to the Anonymous hacker collective declared “cyberwar” against the Russian government. The organisation said it had been subjected to “massive” distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks, which render sites unreachable by bombarding them with spurious requests for information. It came as a Twitter account linked to Anonymous, @YourAnonOne, said the group was at war with the Kremlin. Russia Today said: “After the statement by Anonymous, RT’s websites became the subject of massive DDoS attacks from some 100 million devices, mostly based in the US. Due to the attacks there might be temporary website access limitations for some users, yet RT is promptly resolving these issues.” In a DDoS, a website is deluged with spurious requests for information – described by experts as akin to stuffing a thousand envelopes through a letterbox every second – that render the site unreachable. According to Craig Terron, a senior analyst at Recorded Future, which monitors cyber threats, the Russia Today site remained “intermittently available” on Friday, having gone down at 5pm (2pm GMT) Moscow time on Thursday. “The website is intermittently available, with continued reports of users unable to access the website, as of 1330 Moscow time on February 25,” he said. The Anonymous declaration came as Reuters reported that the government of Ukraine is asking for volunteers from the country’s hacker underground to help protect critical infrastructure and conduct cyber spying missions against Russian troops. Anonymous also claimed on Friday to have hacked and leaked the database of the Russian Ministry of Defence website. As Russian forces attacked cities across Ukraine, requests for volunteers began to appear on hacker forums on Thursday morning, as many residents fled the capital Kyiv. “Ukrainian cybercommunity! It’s time to get involved in the cyber defence of our country,” the post read, asking hackers and cybersecurity experts to submit an application via Google Docs, listing their specialties, such as malware development, and professional references. Yegor Aushev, the co-founder of a cybersecurity company in Kyiv, told Reuters he wrote the post at the request of a senior defence ministry official who contacted him on Thursday. Aushev’s firm Cyber Unit Technologies is known for working with Ukraine’s government on the defense of critical infrastructure. Another person directly involved in the effort confirmed that the request came from the Defense Ministry on Thursday morning. Ukrainian government websites have been hit by DDoS attacks this week and a new strain of wiper malware, dubbed HermeticWiper, has been found on hundreds of computers in the country. Experts have widely attributed the cyber-attacks to Russian state-backed hackers. Russia unleashed data-wiper malware on Ukraine, say cyber expertsRead more A defence attache at Ukraine’s embassy in Washington told Reuters he “cannot confirm or deny information from Telegram channels” referring to the mobile messaging platform, and declined further comment. Aushev said the volunteers would be divided into defensive and offensive cyber units. The defensive unit would be employed to defend infrastructure such as power plants and water systems. In a 2015 cyber-attack, widely attributed to Russia state hackers, 225,000 Ukrainians lost electricity. The offensive volunteer unit Aushev said he is organising would help Ukraine’s military conduct digital espionage operations against invading Russian forces. “We have an army inside our country,” Aushev said. “We need to know what they are doing.” The effort to build a cyber military force is coming late in the game, Aushev acknowledged. 03:37Why has Putin’s Russia waged war on Ukraine? – video explainer A Ukrainian security official said earlier this month that the country had no dedicated military cyber force, the Washington Post reported. “It’s our task to create them this year,” he told the Washington Post. Aushev said that he had already had received hundreds of applicants and was going to begin vetting to ensure that none of them were Russian agents. Reuters also reported on Friday that Ukrainian cybersecurity officials said hackers from neighbouring Belarus are targeting the private email addresses of Ukrainian military personnel “and related individuals”. In an announcement posted to Facebook, Ukraine’s Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT) said the hackers were using password-stealing emails to break into Ukrainian soldiers’ email accounts and using the compromised address books to send further malicious messages.",0

Some had been planning for a Russian invasion for months. They had carefully filled the car with petrol, bought food supplies and packed a getaway bag, just in case. And, in many cases, a carrier for much-loved family pets. Others had done nothing whatsoever. Until Russia’s blitzkrieg invasion began early on Thursday, many people in Kyiv believed the prospect fanciful. And yet the nightmare was real enough: air raid sirens, Russian helicopters flying low against a grey sky in attack formation, the roar of enemy warplanes.  By Friday, as Russian forces approached Kyiv from the north-west, Ukraine responded in two ways. One was by fighting. Its protagonists were soldiers, military veterans, volunteers. Members of the Ukrainian forces tried to hold back a powerful enemy advancing on multiple fronts: from the east and Russia; the south and Crimea; the north and Belarus. The other, bigger group were civilians fleeing the surging conflict – a great, wheeled caravan that filled the road west out of the city, and continued for dozens of miles. For hours this procession of cars scarcely moved. Drivers emerged to stretch their legs. It was unprecedented: Ukraine’s biggest ever jam. Cars sitting at a standstill as people tried to leave Kyiv on Thursday. Photograph: Chris McGrath/Getty Images Those without vehicles had to find other options. There were long queues at Kyiv-Pasazhyrskyi railway station. Some trains were cancelled but a few, remarkably, were running, albeit delayed by five or six hours. Military transport took priority, railway staff explained. Buying a ticket was almost impossible in a panicked city of 3 million people. Some set off on foot, walking along the verge of the E40 road in the early hours of Friday morning, pulling carry-on cases. One departed on a mountain bike. On the day of invasion the Ukrainian government introduced a 10pm-7am curfew. Trains on the Soviet-built Kyiv metro stopped promptly. The underground stations remained open all night, now serving as bomb shelters. “We left at 5.30am when we heard the first explosions,” Vera Ivanovna said, wiping away tears. “I didn’t bring any clothes. I took my mother, nine-year-old daughter and sister.” Ivanovna said she had been driving for 28 hours, after setting off from her home in Sumy, in north-eastern Ukraine, close to the city of Kharkiv and the Russian border. Kremlin tanks had now taken over Sumy, she said, after heavy fighting. “My husband is there. He can’t leave. There are Russian checkpoints now.” She added: “My daughter was due to fly to Egypt. She had packed a bag with a swimsuit in it. We were successful people. We owned a business and an apartment block. Now it’s gone.” Ivanovna said she would drop her sister off at the Polish border and stay with friends in the western city of Lviv. The Polish government was allowing women to enter the country without documents or visas. But Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, banned men of conscription age, between 18 and 60, from exiting Ukraine. There were heart-rending farewells. Damage in Kyiv caused by an explosion. Photograph: Maia Mikhaluk/PA Along the road out of Kyiv, cars queued in vast curving lines to buy petrol. One driver, Dima, said he had fled his home in the city of Vyshhorod, north of the capital, after seeing Russian helicopters in the sky. “There were 30 of them. They flew over us,” he said. The paratroopers on board tried to seize nearby Hostomel airport. What would happen to Kyiv? “It’s kaput,” he said. Not everyone shared this view. A Ukrainian T-72 tank and armoured vehicle were stationed about 12 miles outside Kyiv. Other military vehicles trundled towards battle, as civilians streamed out on both sides of the road. There were new checkpoints, new walls, new realities. Soldiers with flashlights checked documents in the dark. Outside the city of Zhytomyr, police had built an impressive traffic-calming barrier from slabs of local granite. It was the same stone used to build Lenin’s mausoleum on Red Square in Moscow – in the country with which Ukraine was now at war. “Putin has turned into Hitler,” said Dima Yatsenko, a 35-year-old former lawyer. “This is all about his ambitions. He’s a small man like Napoleon.” Yatsenko said Putin had shown his true face after months of pretending to the world he was interested in a diplomatic solution to his grievances over Ukraine and Nato. Yatsenko said he was a little taken aback that Russia’s president had embarked on bloody conflict. “We are motivated. They are not. Look at Afghanistan or Iraq. We will resist and defend our territory,” he said. In normal circumstances the long drive west would have been an attractive one. The road cuts through green flashes of pine forest; crows roost in trees overrun with clumps of mistletoe. There are Catholic churches and homesteads with chickens. With so many cars on the road, there were inevitable crashes and the body of a dead dog. Fighting reaches Kyiv as Russian invasion of Ukraine intensifiesRead more Many of those driving in the darkness were families with small children. Dmitry Vyacheslav – a Kyiv web designer stopping off for petrol at 3am – was travelling with his wife and three children, including the perky Tikon, aged eight months. Vyacheslav held Tikon, dressed in a romper suit, in his arms. “We will try and cross the Romanian border,” he said. The west had acted too slowly to help Ukraine, he added, which now faced extinction as an independent sovereign state. What should happen to Putin? “He should die,” Vyacheslav said. His parents were living in the city of Kherson, north of Crimea, which was on the brink of being overrun. The Russian army had made rapid advances, he said gloomily. Map of key events on day 2 of the Russian invasion. The UN estimates about 5 million Ukrainians from a country of 40 million-plus are likely to escape abroad. According to border authorities, 29,000 people entered Poland from Ukraine on Thursday – invasion day. In Romania, more than 10,000 turned up, with another 3,000 going to Slovakia. It takes six to 12 hours to cross the Polish border. Transport is a growing problem, with taxis hard to find. Petrol stocks are running low. Drivers are only allowed to buy 20 litres each. The road to Medyka, 52 miles from Lviv, was packed with cars. Police directed traffic and relatives hugged loved ones when they arrived on the Polish side. Vera Ivanovna said she was not sure when – or even if – she would see her husband again. She had friends in Russia, she said, all of them appalled and terrified by Putin’s decision to declare war. “The situation is terrible and fantastical. I want to go back to my husband but my mother won’t let me.” She added: “I don’t understand. Why did Putin do this?”",0

Mike Haley, 61, an English teacher and translator who has lived in Kyiv since 2005, said he would remain in the capital with his wife, Ala, regardless of advice from the government that all British nationals should leave.  “I wouldn’t leave my wife,” Haley said. “I just don’t trust this government to behave normally – I have no faith that we would be reunited if I left. It feels like the entire system is rigged against people like us.

As soon as the visa came through, we left,” Bosher said. “We got it in the nick of time. If it hadn’t arrived when it did, we would have been really stuck.” “I would have expected more from the government,” he added. “We knew war was coming – it shouldn’t have been so difficult to get out.” Bosher said he would now get a manual-labour job in the UK to ensure he met the £18,600 minimum income requirement for his wife to stay. On 17 February the Home Office announced new immigration concessions for family members of British nationals, temporarily waiving application fees for those eligible under the family migration route and granting entry for 12 months to those who do not meet the criteria. The department said that family visa decisions would be made within 24 hours of the applicant attending a biometric appointment. On Thursday, the Home Office announced further visa changes for Ukrainians in the UK on work, study or visit visas, temporarily extending their visas and allowing those eligible to switch to different visa routes. Jeremy Myers plans to stay in Poland with his partner, Maria Romanenko, while they wait for a decision on her UK visa application. Photograph: Handout For unmarried couples, the situation is more complex. Jeremy Myers, 44, and his partner, Maria Romanenko, 29, applied for a visitor visa weeks ago. They aren’t married, so they are not eligible for a family visa. “We haven’t been living together for two years and I don’t live in Ukraine full-time, so it’s very different for us,” Myers said. “Maria was charged £45 – a 50% premium – in order not to surrender her passport, just before the country went to war. That was considered a ‘special offer’ due to tough times. “The other thing is that the visa might be rejected, despite always having had a visa for over 15 years, it’s not guaranteed, even now.” The couple planned to leave Kyiv on Friday to travel to Poland, where they would wait for the decision on Maria’s visa application. Marta Mulyak said her mother did not travel to her visa appointment in Kyiv due to the risk posed by Russian bombing.

Mulyak, 39, said: “Although the British government said last week that Ukrainians can apply for visas in different centres in Ukraine, after paying £1,500 you’re only given the option to book the biometrics appointment, where they scan the iris and the fingerprints, in Kyiv. Going to Kyiv, even this Monday, was risky. Some people that I know went just for work and now they cannot leave because there’s bombing. “So my mum’s visa application just ran out of time. And the application is bloody long. My mum had to provide her travel history for 10 years. It has been a real nightmare. I rang the helpline today, yesterday and the day before but they didn’t answer.” Olesya Khromeychuk said the UK should open its borders to Ukrainian refugees.

In a statement, the EBU – an alliance of public service media organisations that produces the contest – said its executive board made the decision after a recommendation made by the Eurovision song contest’s governing body, based on “the rules of the event and the values of the EBU”. They said: “The decision reflects concern that, in light of the unprecedented crisis in Ukraine, the inclusion of a Russian entry in this year’s contest would bring the competition into disrepute. “Before making this decision the EBU took time to consult widely among its membership.

SVT, the Swedish state broadcaster, had criticised this response and called on the EBU to review its decision. Ukraine’s state broadcaster, UA:PBC, also said Russia should be banned from the contest. Russia’s Eurovision delegation have not responded. This year’s Eurovision song contest will take place in May in Turin, after the Italian band Måneskin won last year’s competition. Ukraine have selected the group Kalush Orchestra to represent the country, with the band replacing Alina Pash, the original choice. Pash withdrew on 16 February after scrutiny over a trip she made to Crimea in 2015, which is annexed by Russia. Russia has not yet selected a contestant. The UK culture secretary said she was glad to see Russia had been excluded from the contest. Nadine Dorries tweeted: “Eurovision stands for freedom, unity and respect between countries – watched and enjoyed by tens of millions around the world. Glad to see Eurovision taking action and kicking Russia out.”",0

More than 1,800 people were arrested at rallies across the country on Thursday night as prominent Russians from the worlds of entertainment, business and journalism have risked their livelihoods in order to speak out.  When Elena Chernenko, the veteran diplomatic correspondent for Kommersant newspaper, found out that Russia was invading Ukraine, she said she was stunned. “Of course, I was shocked … Until yesterday morning, I refused to believe that Russia could launch a massive military operation against Ukraine,” said Chernenko, who believed Russia may at most recognise the territories in south-east Ukraine. “I thought that all the talk about invasions was awful hysteria. I argued with people on Twitter and in person that nothing would happen, it’s all thought up,” she said. “Maybe I don’t understand anything about Russian foreign policy anymore.” Russian police detain a protester in Moscow on Friday during a rally against the invasion of Ukraine. Photograph: Maxim Shipenkov/EPA After Putin announced the military operation, she penned an open letter condemning the attack on Ukraine. “War has never been and will never be a method of conflict resolution and there are no excuses for it,” she wrote. Nearly 300 journalists have signed, including representatives of state-run media. In retaliation, she revealed she has been expelled from the diplomatic pool, which she has covered for more than 11 years, for “unprofessionalism”. Chernenko remains a strong critic of Ukraine’s policy toward the Donbas region, but said she could not justify the kind of military operation now unfolding. ‘I fear Putin is unstoppable’: Russians on the invasion of UkraineRead more “There was nothing complicated about it for me,” Chernenko said of her letter. “It was a spontaneous reaction. My country has started a military operation against another … but we’re for diplomacy, we’re for the UN charter, moral values, brotherly nations, and all that. And I had the feeling that this is the wrong path.” An anti-war protest in Moscow. Photograph: Daniil Danchenko/NurPhoto/Rex/Shutterstock Popular actors and musicians, some of whom are employed by the government, have also spoken out and appear to have been punished for their dissent. On Thursday, Ivan Urgant, the host of a popular talk show on state-run Channel One, posted a black square on Instagram with the caption “Fear and pain. No to war.” His show has not gone on air since. Channel One has claimed it is just a scheduling issue, although several reports in Russian media say that they have been blacklisted. TV host Ivan Urgant. Photograph: Mikhail Japaridze/Tass Elena Kovalskaya, the director of the Meyerhold Center in Moscow, quit her job at the state-financed theatre in an act of protest over the war. “It’s impossible to work for a murderer and receive your salary from him,” she wrote of her decision. “Our future is being taken from us,” said Yuri Shevchuk, the frontman of classic Soviet rock band DDT and a veteran anti-war campaigner, who went to Chechnya in 1995 as part of a peace tour. “We’re being pulled like through an ice hole into the past, into the 19th, 18th, 17th centuries. And people refuse to accept it.” He pointed to those in show business who would usually avoid politics now coming out against the war. “Even those pop stars who never talked about politics, who were afraid to lose their shows, honorariums, and so on.” They include mainstream stars like Valery Meladze, as well as more politically minded artists like the rapper Oxxxymiron. He voluntarily cancelled six sold-out shows in Moscow and St Petersburg, writing: “I cannot entertain you when Russian missiles are falling on Ukraine.” Even the family members of some of Russia’s richest businessmen have gone public in their opposition to war. The daughter of Roman Abramovich posted an Instagram picture that read “Putin wants a war with Ukraine,” crossing out the word Russia. “The biggest and most successful lie of Kremlin’s propaganda is that most Russian stand with Putin.” 01:20Russian anti-war protesters face police crackdown and arrests – video And on Friday afternoon, Lisa Peskova, the daughter of Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov, took to Instagram to post a simple message on a black background: #Нетвойне, or “No to war.” So did Tatyana Yumasheva, the daughter of Boris Yeltsin. While the acts of dissent may not change Kremlin policy, they could point to significantly less public or elite support for the current military operation in Ukraine than the annexation of Crimea eight years ago. Hours after Putin announced the military operation, protests broke out on the streets of Moscow and St Petersburg and more than 50 other Russian cities on Thursday evening.

But they were remarkable as a show of defiance despite threats that the government would crack down harder than usual. “Not only did they go to war without us, they won’t even let you protest against a war,” said Zhanna, a young woman with her hair dyed green, pointing to police in riot helmets. “But war is never right. I need to be here because I feel ashamed.” One young man held up a sign that said “Fuck the war!” Within seconds, four police officers had fallen on top of him, dragging him roughly to a police van as media and photographers crowded around.

As the protesters were pushed off the square, they began to march down the broad pavement of Tverskaya Street, chanting “No to war.” A number of protesters said that they wished more people had come out in opposition to the war, a remark echoed by political analysts. “The government can put down nearly any protest at this point,” said Tatyana Stanovaya, the founder of R.Politik. “And in order for the situation to become serious, many more people would have to come out than did so yesterday.” Rally on Pushkin Square, Moscow on 24 February against the invasion of Ukraine. Photograph: Kommersant Photo Agency/Rex/Shutterstock Despite the odds stacked against them, many Russians have said they feel it is their duty to speak out whatever the consequences. “They are all doing this without worrying about their own future and threats,” said Dmitry Muratov, the Nobel prize-winning editor of Novaya Gazeta. “These people have all spoken very clearly to say that they are against this bloodshed. And that is very inspiring for me.” Muratov released dual editions of his newspaper in both Russian and Ukrainian this week and has said that his newspaper would defy the Russian media watchdog’s rules that they only report official government information about the war, trusting reporting only from their own newsroom. He believes the war is an unpopular one for most Russians. “The memory of the [second world] war, and that people have relatives in Ukraine, and that Ukraine is a dear country to us, it holds back even the most rabid supporters of the current leadership,” said Muratov. “There is no enthusiasm for this.”",0

The ensuing humiliation and isolation felt by the Russian people was exactly the sort of climate would-be nationalist demagogues are able to exploit to dangerous effect, and Vladimir Putin’s egregious attack on Ukraine is now an outcome for which we in the west are, at least partly, responsible. There will come a time – though it is unlikely to be soon and the task may not initially be easy, given the newly kindled fears and suspicions of eastern European states – when the fall of Putin gives the west an opportunity to begin to build a much more positive and cordial relationship with Russia. This is something many of its currently suppressed citizens would warmly welcome. We should be especially mindful of the mistake we made 30 years ago when that chance arises.Dr Gerald DunningTonteg, Pontypridd  Whatever European politicians might say, they cannot disguise the fact that they are unwilling to take action to prevent aggressive Russian incursions into their homeland. The events leading up to the invasion seem suspiciously similar to the appeasement of Hitler. It was a no-no for western countries and Nato to help Ukraine equip its armed forces against possible Russian aggression, for fear of upsetting Vladimir Putin. Perhaps Germany’s offer of 5,000 protective helmets symbolises the weakness of the European approach. Although through inaction the west has made it almost impossible to offer help to Ukrainians, it has a moral obligation to do so. The west must not repeat the humiliation of Budapest in 1956, when, having encouraged the Hungarians to rise against the Communist government, it did nothing to help when the Russian tanks rolled into Budapest. Timothy Garton Ash is right that the west must act to prevent similar incursions in future. However, can European politicians rise to the occasion and take the necessary action to curb Putin? Looking at British politics, I can only see the unlikelihood of the necessary pan-European action being taken. At present, our politics is dominated by an insular, Europhobic Conservative party and government in thrall to the City of London and Russian money. Not the politicians capable of leading, or being part of, an effective collaborative effort to restrain Russia.Derrick JoadLeeds When nations are backed into a corner, they eventually lash out. Hitler was Germany’s disastrous response to the onerous war reparations inflicted by the first world war victors. Vladimir Putin is Russia’s disastrous response to the triumphal advance of Nato and the EU across the old Soviet fiefdoms of eastern Europe. Nelson Mandela, uniquely, understood that it is crucial for victors to be magnanimous, to offer friendship to those they defeated, and thus seek to avoid renewed conflict. We have not learned from him. Putin is a monster. But we, the west, were the midwives at his birth.David AllenNottingham Finally, after dithering as usual, the prime minister has had to recognise reality, admitting that “this is a catastrophe for our continent”. He now appears to align the United Kingdom with the continent of Europe and to recognise the need for unified action. What a pity he didn’t accept that before tearing apart one of the most useful alliances in history. No one is going to pay attention to this country on its own, and we are hardly going to achieve peace with two of the most heinous liars in the world dealing with the situation.Larry JohnstonBrecon, Powys Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

29,"Friday, 25 February 2022",2022-02-25,"We’re appalled by Putin now, but be clear: the west gave him the green light",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/feb/25/putin-west-gave-him-green-light-russia-ukraine,,"The History Channel is broadcasting live. The US commentator who made that quip meant that events currently unfolding in Ukraine will be remembered for many decades to come, that future generations of schoolchildren will be called to memorise the date of 24 February 2022. But it’s true in another, darker sense too. For this is a grimly retro war. Russian troops marching across an international border, closing in on a European capital? Families sheltering in underground stations, children parted from their fathers, civilians donning uniforms and reaching for rifles, vowing to fight to the death for their homeland? An actual invasion of one European country by another? Footage of such events looks strange in colour: it should be in grainy black and white. Because Europe was meant to have left such events behind, if not in the 1940s – when the Nazi bombardment of Kyiv began at 4am one day in 1941, rather than the 5am hour chosen on Thursday by Vladimir Putin – then later in the 20th century, when Soviet tanks rolled into Budapest in 1956 or Prague in 1968. Instead, history is back – confronting us with a choice we imagined we’d made long ago.  The choice was set out as starkly as it could be, by the leaders of the two countries now locked in uneven combat. Putin spoke twice, his first address repeatedly described as rambling and incoherent, but no less chilling for that. Between the two appearances, Putin set out a justification for invasion that, naturally, rested on lies. He claimed Moscow had to invade, to save eastern Ukraine’s Russian speakers from a genocidal threat that did not exist. He would rescue Ukraine from rule by “neo-Nazis”, an odd way to describe a country whose president and recent prime minister are both Jews, both democrats. But underneath the spurious defences lay the Putin worldview. His objection was not, as Putin’s western apologists on the far right and far left would have it, merely to Nato expansion, but something rather more fundamental. Putin argued that Ukraine was not a proper country, implying that of the states born out of the collapsed Soviet Union, only one was real and legitimate: Russia. All the rest were confections, whose right to exist was hazy and to be determined by Putin himself, by force of arms if necessary. Taking him by his word and by his deeds, Putin believes he has the right to redraw the map of Europe, and to do so in blood. Not long afterwards, Ukraine’s Volodymyr Zelenskiy also addressed the Russian people, and he too spoke in Russian. It was a speech for the ages, one that deserves to be read now and long after this crisis is over. For it did not just plead his people’s case, though it did that: “Lots of you have relatives in Ukraine. You know our character, our principles, what matters to us.” It did not just make the case against all wars: “People lose their loved ones and themselves.” It specifically set out the principle at stake: “international law, the right to determine your own future”. 01:18Kyiv apartment building hit as Ukrainians fight off Russian attacks – video report This, then, is the choice. Do we want to live in the world described by Zelenskiy, where democratic states are protected by an international system of rules, however flawed and inconsistent that system might be? Or do we want to live in Putin’s world, governed by the law of the jungle and where the only right is might? We think we know which side we’re on. We want to stand with those bleary-eyed children, clutching their colouring books as they bed down in a Kyiv subway station. We tell ourselves we stand with them and against Putin and his war of aggression. But do we? Because Putin had hardly kept his worldview secret until now. On the contrary, he had acted on it at least three times in the past 15 years, each time paying little price. He seized a chunk of Georgia in 2008 and of Ukraine in 2014, to say nothing of his decision to adopt the Assad regime’s murderous war against the Syrian people as his own a year later. We may have forgotten about all that – the Russian dissident Garry Kasparov laments the “amnesia of the west” – but Putin had not. He noted the western shrug that greeted his annexation of Crimea: how, just four years later, Russia was cheerfully hosting the football World Cup. There was no beefing up of Ukrainians’ defences, so that they might protect themselves against this moment. There was no clearout of oligarch money from Londongrad. Putin understood the signal: it was a green light. And what are we proposing to do to stop him now, even as he invades his neighbour? The latest rounds of economic sanctions are hardly crippling, not when Moscow has friends, starting with China, that are willing to soften the blow. But even if the measures were stronger, there’s no guarantee they would work. Both Bashar al-Assad and the regime in Tehran have faced sanctions for years; they’re still standing, their behaviour barely changed. The problem is an obvious one: Putin does not care if his people suffer. He’s priced in the hit to his oligarch pals, just as he’s priced in the loss of Russian military lives. For him, conquering Ukraine – and removing the example of a democratic neighbour that might show Russians a different life is possible – is worth it. The west has a duty to help defend Ukraine – and to help Russia by ensuring its defeat | Keir GilesRead more But if confronting Putin economically is ineffective, confronting him militarily is barely plausible or palatable. The Russian dictator was at pains to remind the west that his is a “powerful nuclear state”. Analysts say that Putin does not see Russia’s nuclear capability as theoretical: it is absorbed into his military strategy. No one would want to tangle with such a man, not least as he seems to drift ever further away from stable rationality. Apparently modest options – perhaps enforcing a no-fly zone over Ukraine – run into the same problems: it would mean Nato being at war with Russia. We can hope for a palace coup against the tsar. We can send our solidarity and admiration to those Russian anti-war protesters brave enough to take to the streets, hoping they might somehow topple the autocrat ruining so many lives. But these are no more than wishes. The grimmer prospect is that Putin understands something about the 21st century few of us want to face: that this is an age of impunity, especially for those who have a vast and deadly arsenal but no shame. That is what’s at stake in this moment. Beijing understands it: if Russia can take Ukraine, why can’t China snatch Taiwan? Kseniia understands it too. She is the young Kyiv resident who, after a night in a subway station, told the BBC: “We are like a shield for Europe and for the world. We fight for the freedom of the world.” She is right – and yet she, and her country, are terribly alone. Jonathan Freedland is a Guardian columnist

30,"Friday, 25 February 2022",2022-02-25,Western powers have realised Russia is largely immune to sanctions,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/25/western-powers-have-realised-russia-is-largely-immune-to-sanctions-ukraine-putin,,"The war against Russia is one western countries want to fight with only economic sanctions, not guns. Russia’s conflict with Ukraine, despite its long gestation and planning by Vladimir Putin and his supporters in the Kremlin, was supposed to end quickly once financial retaliation began. Yes, there would be military skirmishes on the ground, but little more than a few casualties were expected once a range of penalties began to bite.  The western powers have quickly realised that unless they are willing to fire the financial equivalent of a nuclear arsenal, Putin has made sure Russia is largely immune, at least in the short term. Over a decade, Kremlin policy has carefully reduced domestic public and private sector debt and allowed the central bank time to build a war chest of foreign assets large enough to shore up the country’s finances for months, if not years. This means that the sanctions put in place over the past couple of days by the EU, US, UK, Japan and Canada are unlikely to have any significant effect on the Russian economy or its financial stability. Only the full package of measures used against Iran – shutting Russia out of the international payments system, Swift, while also banning purchases of Russian oil and gas – will do the trick. As Hosuk Lee-Makiyama, the head of the European Centre for International Political Economy, said, Europe has allowed itself to become more integrated with Russia, while Russia has separated itself from Europe. He said EU countries owned a combined €300bn of Russian assets that would be vulnerable to confiscation if a full-blooded financial war broke out. The UK owns billions more via firms such as BP, which has a near-20% stake in the Russian oil company Rosneft. “Sanctions are one of the few options that European countries have in a conflict situation like this. If you disconnect North Korea or Iran from the international financial system, you do not expose yourself to that much damage.” Speaking on BBC News, he added: “But while I don’t say it is impossible to envisage Russia being barred from the Swift system, it is a nuclear option that means you exterminate yourself along with your enemy.” Swift (the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication) is the main secure messaging system that banks use to make rapid and secure cross-border payments, allowing international trade to flow smoothly. It transmits trillions of dollars’ worth of deals every day, but is coming under pressure from a Chinese government-backed rival, Cips, which Russia could use to conduct its financial business deals supplemented by direct transactions with counterparties. It is also possible for the G7 countries and EU to ban the purchase of Russian gas and oil, but commodities analysts agree that while there is spare capacity in oil markets to make up for the loss of Russian supplies with a price rise limited to $140 a barrel, there is no hope of boosting gas output to fill a gap created by a Russia ban. Shortages would quickly force countries in Europe to ration gas and the price would be likely to rocket back to nine times normal levels, as seen before Christmas, stirring memories of the 1974 oil price shock. Andrew Kenningham, the chief Europe economist at the consultancy Capital Economics, said that while some countries – the Czech Republic and the Baltic states – had pushed for bans on Russian gas, “others are more reluctant and it would presumably take much more devastating developments in the conflict to trigger such measures”. Tom Mayne, a Russia expert at the thinktank Chatham House, said there was room to improve the current sanctions that allow a Russian kleptocracy access to London’s financial markets. In a report last year, the thinktank said an effective anti-kleptocracy drive would “close legal loopholes, demand transparency from public institutions, deploy anti-corruption sanctions against post-Soviet elites and prosecute British professionals who enable money laundering by kleptocrats”. Even the ramped-up sanctions announced by Boris Johnson fall short of this effective ban on illegal Russian money entering UK economic life. The UK is keen to go further than the EU with restrictions on Russian energy imports, but the EU has allowed itself to be much more dependent than the UK, limiting its appetite for further sanctions. Without bans on gas and oil exports, and expulsion from international payments systems, the impact of sanctions will be limited.",0

34,"Friday, 25 February 2022",2022-02-25,BA owner IAG reports €3.5bn loss as it monitors Ukraine developments,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/feb/25/ba-owner-iag-reports-loss-as-it-monitors-ukraine-developments,,"British Airways’ owner has said a return to profit was still on course this year despite war in Ukraine and rising oil prices, with its battered share price nosing upwards on Friday after a week of market turmoil. International Airlines Group said it had more than halved its losses to €3.5bn (£2.9bn) in 2021, having slashed staff and costs during the pandemic, and could still return to the black this year should its operations avoid further fallout from Covid-19.  Despite industry optimism for recovery only a week ago, when the global airline body Iata spoke of growing momentum as restrictions eased, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine had sent IAG stocks tumbling on Thursday. Aero engine maker Rolls-Royce’s share price dropped even faster this week, down 15% with market sentiment worsened by the resignation of its chief executive, Warren East. BA said, however, that the Russian overflight ban on UK carriers announced on Friday would have only a “minimal” impact on its operations, with growth plans targeted firmly westwards across the Atlantic rather than back towards east Asia, where Covid restrictions have curtailed passenger traffic. The airline is hoping to restore much of its route network that was shredded by coronavirus, including getting flights to North America back to 100% of pre-pandemic capacity. The company, which made a record €7.4bn loss in 2020, said passenger numbers were still only 36% of pre-Covid levels last year. Flights and bookings were still impacted by Omicron in the first months of 2022, and IAG said it would make a “significant” loss in the first quarter, when capacity will be about 65% of pre-pandemic levels. Nevertheless, it expects to return to profit in the second quarter, driven by an increase in bookings for Easter and summer that will underpin “significantly positive” operating profit and cashflows for 2022. “This assumes no further setbacks related to Covid-19 and government-imposed travel restrictions or material impact from recent geopolitical developments,” the company said. Luis Gallego, IAG’s chief executive, said the company was “monitoring events closely to manage any potential impact”. He said: “We are confident that a strong recovery is under way. We expect a robust summer with IAG returning to around 85% of its 2019 capacity for the full year. Our model enables us to capture revenue and cost synergies while maximising efficiencies, which means we are set up to return to profitability in 2022.” BA’s chief executive, Sean Doyle, played down the impact of Russia’s retaliatory ban on British airlines in its airspace, after the UK ban on the Russian flag carrier Aeroflot. BA flew to the Russian capital, Moscow, three times a week but did not fly to any other destinations in Russia or Ukraine – nor did it use Ukrainian airspace. Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk Doyle said the closure of Russian airspace to BA would have less of an impact than before Covid-19. He said: “All of our services are carrying on with minor routing changes. We’re not flying to Japan and China today, but we would have had at least a daily service to China that would typically fly over Russian airspace.” Routes to Pakistan and India could require as much as 60-90 minutes’ extra flying time, he said, while taking a southerly route to Singapore and Australia would mean only a small additional time in the air. He said the affected regions had already been “on hold” and not part of BA’s plans for 2022. Shares in IAG that fell 6% on Thursday after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, amid fears that the conflict could impact the travel and aviation sector, rose by 3.5% on Friday. Rolls-Royce also recovered to the tune of 4%. But IAG’s shares still remain down a fifth over the past year. IAG also said it could ride out the rising oil prices, traditionally a millstone for airlines, after the price of a barrel rose to more than $100 (£75). Steve Gunning, the chief financial officer, said the airline’s fuel price was 60% hedged for the full year and noted: “The last time the oil price touched $100 a barrel the group achieved an operating margin of 14.4%.” Richard Hunter, the head of markets at Interactive Investor, said: “There is little question that IAG has taken some formidable steps to ensure survival, but from the company’s own outlook it appears unlikely that a full return to normality will land until 2023, and even then the company will be markedly different from the one which entered the crisis.”",0

Yet London continues to pull its punches. In a mirthless sort of way, I enjoyed Boris Johnson thundering on Thursday that “oligarchs in London will have nowhere to hide”. Righto. That same morning, Andrey Guryev, the reported owner of Witanhurst, London’s second largest house after Buckingham Palace, could be seen on telly at Putin’s meeting of the oligarchs in the Kremlin. Not a great hiding place – but then, perhaps Andrey knows the seeker is so quarter-arsed he doesn’t actually need one. London’s fight against oligarchs reminds me a lot of Russia’s fight against doping in sports. Some real through-the-looking-glass stuff. Anyway, I say that Guryev is the “reported owner” of Witanhurst, because even that simple fact remains extraordinarily difficult to establish, to say nothing of more controversial information. For so many of these Russian persons of interest, the internet management alone is a full-time job. But then, there are so very many full-timers. In a few weeks you will be able to buy the brilliant Oliver Bullough’s new book, Butler to the World, in which he details how the UK became the servant of some of the world’s worst individuals. To help the oligarchs, the kleptocrats and the gangsters, Londongrad boasts a whole humming, interconnected professional class of reality-launderers specifically designed to service them – lawyers and lobbyists and education consultants and all sorts of others who imagine themselves to work for respectable businesses. But don’t. I thought of them when I read an article by Marta Shokalo, editor of the BBC’s Ukrainian service, written in the hours after the invasion began on Thursday. She described hearing the explosions in Kyiv and, later, getting her 10-year-old son up and dressed. “We had some breakfast, sitting as far from the windows as we could,” she wrote, “but he was so scared he vomited.” Reading this yesterday before supper with my own children I felt such a deep, painful sympathy for her. There is no one working to launder reality for her child. There is no army of sharp-suited professionals lavishing painstaking hours on making all the bad stuff go away for Ukrainian children, two of whom were reportedly killed in the past 24 hours by Russian strikes on civilian targets. It is their misfortune – their tragedy – to live at the sharp end of Vladimir Putin’s wickedness, while the megarich who exist in grotesque symbiosis with the Russian president have their every rough edge smoothed off in this capital they most adore to call home. Or, as Bullough now asks: “Why are we preferring Russian oligarchs over Ukrainian kids?” Why indeed? I don’t want to go out on a limb here, but Britain’s professed attempt to deter Putin with sanctions was arguably hindered by not imposing any even remotely irksome sanctions until after he’d actually invaded Ukraine. Less “stop or we’ll shoot”, more “shoot or we’ll stop”. For so long now, the urgency and gravitas that successive governments have brought to this problem are epitomised by Gavin Williamson’s comment that “Russia should go away and should shut up”. Boris Johnson claims the UK is rooting out dirty Russian money. That’s ludicrous | Oliver BulloughRead more That, you might recall, came in the wake of Putin deploying a nerve agent on our soil. Even now, just typing those words is a proper mindmelt. Not one month before, the wife of Putin’s former deputy finance minister had successfully bid £30,000 at a Tory party fundraiser to have dinner with Williamson at the Churchill war rooms. Indeed, this same woman, Lubov Chernukhin, has spent a fortune buying time with politicians, including £160,000 to play tennis with David Cameron and Boris Johnson. The year after Salisbury, she paid £135,000 for “a night out with Theresa May”. (I know, I know – second prize was two nights out with Theresa May.) We’ve even seen a picture of this soiree, thanks to trigger-happy Instagrammer Liz Truss, who came along for the fun, along with several other senior Tory women. The future foreign secretary genuinely captioned the picture: “And it’s ladies night #cabinetandfriends #girlpower.” As one fellow attender fumed of Truss, she’d “dropped them in it for the sake of a few likes”. Which sounds like the words of someone who’d prefer that their money-grubbing and influence-peddling happened in secret. In Londongrad, of course, they would be in positively multitudinous company. As Putin closes in physically on Ukraine’s capital, our own capital has yet to properly instigate a reckoning with itself. Instead, the people with power to hit his cronies where it hurts still prefer to just shut up and go away. Marina Hyde is a Guardian columnist

38,"Friday, 25 February 2022",2022-02-25,Fighting reaches Kyiv as Russian invasion of Ukraine intensifies,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/25/ukraine-invasion-explosions-in-kyiv-as-uk-reports-fierce-resistance-across-the-nation,,"Fighting has reached the suburbs and historic centre of Kyiv as Russian troops closed in on the Ukrainian capital, while Moscow indicated it was ready to talk and Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, pleaded for international help. After early morning missile attacks, Russian forces advanced to the city’s outskirts from three sides on Friday as Ukrainian soldiers set up defensive positions at key bridges and patrolled in armoured vehicles watched by anxious residents.  A day after Russia launched a massive invasion of its south-western neighbour, the defence ministry in Moscow claimed it had cut Kyiv off from the west and seized a strategic airport at Hostomel, on the outskirts, allowing it to airlift troops to the front. In an extraordinary message addressed to Ukrainian troops, the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, called on them to overthrow the government, whose leaders he described as “terrorists” and “a gang of drug addicts and neo-Nazis”. Ukrainian officials said 1,000 Russian servicemen had been killed so far, but warned that advance enemy units had already entered the Obolonskyi district of northern Kyiv. The defence ministry advised residents to “prepare molotov cocktails”. Fight for Kyiv map The mayor of Kyiv, Vitali Klitschko, said the city had entered “a defensive phase”. He added: “Shots and explosions are ringing out … and saboteurs have already entered Kyiv. The enemy wants to put the capital on its knees and destroy us.” The Kremlin spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, said Russia was ready to send a delegation, including foreign and defence ministry officials, to the Belarusian capital, Minsk, for talks with Ukraine, providing the country agreed to demilitarise. Ukraine has said it is willing to discuss declaring itself a neutral county. The Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, also said Moscow was ready for talks if Ukrainian forces laid down their arms. “No one is planning to occupy Ukraine,” Lavrov said, insisting Russia’s troops were freeing Ukraine from “oppression”. Zelenskiy pleaded with western powers to act faster to cut off Russia’s economy and provide Ukraine with military assistance. “When bombs fall on Kyiv, it happens in Europe, not just in Ukraine,” he said. “When missiles kill our people, they kill all Europeans.” The west scrambled to respond to Putin’s aggression with a range of fresh sanctions against Moscow, with the US also announcing it would send a further 7,000 troops to Germany to shore up Nato’s eastern borders. There were divisions, however, on the strength of the response. The US president, Joe Biden, and his Nato counterparts sought to reassure member countries on the alliance’s eastern flank, from Estonia to Bulgaria, that their security was guaranteed as Russian forces advanced on Kyiv. “Russia has shattered peace on the European continent,” the Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, said as he opened a video summit. “Moscow bears sole responsibility for the deliberate, cold-blooded and long-planned invasion.” The UN security council will also vote on Friday on a draft resolution condemning Russia’s invasion and requiring an immediate withdrawal – although Moscow can veto the measure and it was unclear how China would vote. The EU on Friday was set to freeze European assets linked to Putin and Lavrov and introduce more measures against Russian banks and industry after facing angry remonstrations from Kyiv for holding back from cutting Russia out of the Swift international payments system through which it receives foreign currency. Zelenskiy earlier on Friday accused Europe of not being hard or quick enough in sanctioning Russia earlier, urging citizens to compel their governments to do more to stop Putin’s invasion. “Europe has enough strength to stop this aggression,” he said. “You have to act swiftly. We demand effective counteraction to the Russian Federation. Sanctions must be further strengthened.” France’s finance minister, Bruno Le Maire, said as he arrived for an EU meeting in Brussels that further sanctions were likely. “This isn’t enough. We need to choke the Russian system and in particular further target the oligarchs,” he said. 03:37Why has Putin’s Russia waged war on Ukraine? – video explainer According to a leaked draft of the new sanctions agreed by EU leaders, all members of the Duma, the Russian security council and any Belarusian officials in the military and ministry of defence who “facilitated” the invasion of Ukraine will be subject to travel bans and asset freezes. Le Maire said, however, that ejecting Russia from Swift, which would have serious economic consequences for leading EU member states including Germany, France and Italy, would be “a very last resort”. Beyond the diplomatic arena, Uefa moved the Champions League final to Paris from St Petersburg, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) called on international sports federations to cancel all current or future sporting events in Russia, and Russia was ejected from the Eurovision song contest. The invasion could drive up to 5 million people to flee abroad, UN aid agencies said on Friday, adding that at least 100,000 people are already uprooted in the country and fuel, cash and medical supplies were running low. Streams of people – mostly women and children, since Ukrainian men aged 18-60 are forbidden to leave – crossed into Hungary, Poland and Romania, with 15-hour queues reported at border points. Guards fired warning shots to prevent a stampede at Kyiv’s central station as thousands tried to force their way on to evacuation trains. Earlier on Friday, heavy pre-dawn blasts in Kyiv set off a second day of violence after Putin on Thursday defied western warnings to unleash the biggest attack on a European state since the second world war. A Ukrainian police officer stands in front of a damaged residential block in Kyiv on Friday. Photograph: Chris McGrath/Getty Images “Horrific Russian rocket strikes on Kyiv,” Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, tweeted. “Last time our capital experienced anything like this was in 1941 when it was attacked by Nazi Germany. Ukraine defeated that evil and will defeat this one.” Cleaning broken glass from her room, one Kyiv resident, Oxana Gulenko, said: “How we can live through it in our time? What should we think. Putin should be burned in hell along with his whole family.” Witnesses said loud explosions could also be heard in Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second-biggest city, close to the border with Russia, while air raid sirens sounded over Lviv in the west. A resident told the Guardian the eastern city of Sumy had been taken. Day two nationwide map In the village of Starognativka, near the frontline where separatists have faced off against Kyiv’s forces for years, a local official, Volodymyr Veselkin, said missiles had been raining down all morning and the power was out. “They are trying to wipe the village off the face of the earth,” he said. Decision to invade Ukraine raises questions over Putin’s ‘sense of reality’Read more Zelenskiy said in a televised address that Putin was targeting civilian as well as military sites. “They say that civilian objects are not a target for them. It is a lie; they do not distinguish in which areas to operate,” he said, vowing to continue defending his country and criticising world leaders for “watching from afar”. The international criminal court said on Friday it might investigate possible war crimes, though did not provide any further details. Putin says Ukraine is an illegitimate state carved out of Russia, although his ultimate aims remain obscure. In Russia, thousands of people defied tough anti-protest legislation to stage anti-war rallies across the country on Thursday night. OVD-Info, which monitors arrests at opposition protests, said more than 1,800 people in 59 cities had been detained.",0
39,"Friday, 25 February 2022",2022-02-25,‘Pure Orwell’: how Russian state media spins invasion as liberation,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/25/pure-orwell-how-russian-state-media-spins-ukraine-invasion-as-liberation,,"Turn on Russian state television on Friday afternoon and you will see little sign that the country’s missiles are pounding the Ukrainian capital. Instead, the full force of the state propaganda machine has been mobilised to portray Moscow’s invasion as a defensive campaign to “liberate” Ukraine, focusing much of its coverage on the alleged protection of the Donbas, supposedly under attack by Kyiv.  “Our situation is very concerning. The enemy is attacking our positions, entering civilian houses,” said Leonid Pasechnik, the leader of the self-proclaimed republic in Luhansk, to the Rossiya-24 channel. RT news channel in spotlight in UK over pro-Russia slant on Ukraine crisisRead more A breaking news banner on Channel One said that “Ukraine launched three missiles at the Donetsk People’s Republic in the last seven minutes”. The Russian state news mostly follows Vladimir Putin’s narrative on the war, which he laid out in his address to the nation early on Thursday morning when he announced a limited “special military operation” to “demilitarise” Ukraine and protect citizens in the Donbas from what he claimed was a Ukrainian “genocide”. Throughout Friday morning, a Russian assault on the Ukrainian capital was often simply denied. “Kyiv, as a city where civilians live, hasn’t been bombed by anyone. There hasn’t been any terror there or instructions to cause such terror,” said the Channel One pundit Artyom Sheinin on Friday, contradicting the myriad of reports that have shown the opposite. As it becomes harder for state media to ignore the full-scale invasion into Ukrainian territory, some channels have started to frame Russian soldiers as eagerly anticipated liberators. “The people in the city Kharkiv only have one issue with the Russian army: ‘What took you so long?’” said Olga Skabeyeva, one of the country’s most prominent state television hosts. Coverage of the invasion contrasts steeply with that of other Russian military campaigns. During Russia’s 2015 military intervention in Syria, viewers were often treated to flashy videos of fighter jets destroying their targets. The avoidance of such videos this time serves as a sign that Russian authorities are aware of the country’s deep unease with the conflict. Television remains the biggest news source for Russians despite becoming less trusted over the past decade, past polling has found, and 62% of the population say they get their news from television. But polls also show that most people under 40 prefer to get their news online and from social media. Despite a state crackdown on Russian media, readers can still choose from several independent outlets that have been reporting critically on the country’s involvement in the war, including the popular online platform Meduza and the television channel Dozhd – both recently branded as “foreign agents”. Those who can read English are still able to access foreign press, and there are also many popular independent Telegram channels run by journalists turned bloggers. In contrast to WhatsApp, the widely used encrypted messaging app Telegram allows readers to “follow” users in a similar way to Twitter, which is accessed by only 3% of the population. Alexei Pivovarov, a veteran Russian journalist, runs a channel with almost 500,000 followers, aggregating independent news on the war coming from Russia, Ukraine and the west. Other channels are more opinionated. Commenting on a recent statement by the Kremlin official Valentina Matviyenko, who defended the invasion by saying it “was is the only option to stop a brotherly war”, the Telegram user Stalingulag wrote to his 300,000 followers: “This is pure Orwell, War is Peace, Freedom is Slavery.” Signs are emerging that the Kremlin will try to gain a monopoly on the way Russians perceive events in Ukraine by censoring independent outlets reporting on the war. On Thursday Russia’s media watchdog, Roskomnadzor, demanded that Russian media cite only “official information and data” when covering the conflict. The watchdog vowed to immediately block outlets that did not comply with the order. In a similar move, Russia previously threatened to block at least 10 news outlets unless they deleted their coverage of video investigations by the jailed Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny into high-level corruption. Most outlets gave in to the demands. Over at the state broadcaster RT – which has parroted many of the themes on the war that were aired on Russian state television – the first signs have emerged that its staff are uncomfortable with the network’s war coverage. At least one English-language RT staff member and one frequent RT contributor in Moscow have quit the network in recent days over the editorial position on the war, the Guardian has learned. “In light of recent events, earlier today I resigned from RT with immediate effect,” the former RT staff news writer in Moscow Jonny Tickle tweeted on Thursday. The frequent RT contributor who resigned said, on condition of anonymity, that there had “been an exodus of staff already” at the channel. “Several people already quit – and lots more said to be contemplating.”",0
40,"Friday, 25 February 2022",2022-02-25,War in Ukraine is a severe test of China’s new axis with Russia,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/feb/25/war-in-ukraine-china-russia-beijing-alliance-moscow-invasion,,"President Vladimir Putin’s full military escalation in Ukraine has unsettled his seemingly best friend in international affairs, the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, who has invested in the bilateral relationship personally and politically. Beijing’s axis with Moscow was recently strengthened during the 2022 Winter Olympics, with their joint declaration to proclaim “their cooperation with no limit”. The western foreign affairs community then rushed to conclude that Moscow and Beijing were forming – if one had not already been formed – a “strategic alliance” aimed at destabilising the liberal, rules-based world order. Some in the west assume Beijing will inevitably support Russia’s military actions in Ukraine. However, cooperation would have to come with some substantial limits to avoid undermining Beijing’s own priorities and interests in the eyes of Chinese foreign policy planners. For various reasons, the Kremlin’s latest military exercise is both a conundrum and a source of equally unexpected opportunities for Beijing.  Ukraine invasion news: Russia says it has taken airport north of Kyiv as city enters ‘defensive phase’ – live updatesRead more In line with a difficult balancing act, the Chinese foreign minister, Wang Yi, had publicly stated that all countries’ sovereignty and territorial integrity should be protected, including Ukraine’s; and Russia and Ukraine should return to the negotiating table. That is widely regarded as the most clearcut position China has delivered on the current situation and was echoed by a phone call between Xi and Putin today. China’s stance crystallises two elements: first, it does not support the Kremlin’s move against Ukraine, and views Moscow’s actions as a violation of national sovereignty and the UN charter – one of the cardinal principles of Beijing’s foreign policies since 1949. Second, and most important, China strongly implies there is no comparison between Ukraine and Taiwan – the former is a sovereign state and the latter is not a full UN member but a unique polity, seen as a renegade province by Beijing. But China will carefully watch the west’s willingness and resolve to respond to the situation in Ukraine, which may well serve as a reference to Taiwan later. The Kremlin’s military adventurism will also damage China economically to some extent. As Russia’s biggest trade partner, China has significant investments and financial ties with Russia that will be exposed to the west’s sanctions. Such sanctions most certainly come with an acute pain for many fossil fuel-focused state-owned enterprises. Equally, Beijing is Kyiv’s top trade partner, and has enjoyed friendly ties with Ukraine, which is a source of grain and military equipment. Nonetheless, Beijing will measure its reaction to Ukraine through the lens of US-China competition. To this end, the Ukraine crisis provides two unexpected opportunities for President Xi. China views the Ukraine situation as a timely distraction that will draw the US away from the Indo-Pacific region and back to Europe, at least prior to the US midterm elections in November. This offers an unexpected sigh of relief to China as the primary strategic rival to the US. Without deliberate coordination, Beijing and Moscow have already acted as force multipliers to undermine the US’s capability through their individual actions. It is correct to assume that Russia and China see world affairs in a similar light, not least in their antipathy to liberal values. Deepened bilateral cooperation allows the two countries to demonstrate great power status on the world stage, either to counterbalance the dominance of the US or to further their own geopolitical aims. China ponders how Russia’s actions in Ukraine could reshape world order Read more However, Beijing will have to consider the balance sheet for this current alignment carefully. If the cost of alignment comes at a far greater price than the actual benefit, Beijing must reach its own conclusion and tread carefully. Beijing hoped that Russia would offer full diplomatic support to its various global initiatives under a plethora of UN-led platforms, in the context of competition with the US. But Moscow’s current move has made China’s wishes more problematic. Russia’s recklessness serves as a spur for China to rethink its return on its alignment with the Kremlin, and it may wish to minimise the risks associated with Russia’s fraught relations with the west. China may well prepare a discreet course correction to soften its harsh diplomatic rhetoric, and a pathway of less hostile ties with the west to demonstrate its maturity in dealing with a major world crisis. History does serve as a good lesson for the Chinese Communist party: Nikita Khrushchev withdrew all assistance to support China’s nascent industrial development because Beijing refused to become a junior partner of Moscow in political and military terms in the 1950s. The Sino-Soviet split of the 1950s and 60s took place in a very different world, but its spectre remains alive in Beijing and Moscow, and is unlikely to be exorcised in the near future.

The company reported a 45% rise revenues to $14.1bn in 2021, primarily from the sale of steel but also from coal, while pre-tax profit more than trebled from $1.3bn to $4.2bn.  The result was founded on rising prices, amid soaring demand for steel as the global economy rebounds from the impact of Covid-19. However, the company, whose operations are largely based in Russia, warned it could suffer the effects if the UK, US and Europe step up sanctions against Russian entities in response to Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine. Evraz has not been included on the list of sanctioned Russian companies, such as the airline Aeroflot and VTB Bank. Speaking on a conference call, at which journalists were not permitted to ask questions, the chief finance officer, Nikolay Ivanov, said it was too soon to say whether the company would be affected by sanctions, including any impact on its lending banks. “Currently, we are analysing the impact of potential sanctions imposed just last night,” he said. “We believe it will not have significant impact on the company.” However, in its annual report, Evraz said “policies adopted by the Russian government” had increased uncertainty and the risk of the imposition of sanctions, which could have an adverse affect on the business. The company has also run a simulation of how sanctions could affect profits, including the potential loss of all exports outside the Russian-influenced Commonwealth of Independent States. It said it could be forced to defer dividends, which would potentially mean a cut in the annual income of the billionaire owner of Chelsea football club, Abramovich, who owns 29% of Evraz. The company gave investors a dividend of $1.55bn this year, of which Abramovich is entitled to just under $450m. Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk Abramovich has not been a target for sanctions. Contacted by the Guardian last week, lawyers for the billionaire said Evraz did not fit the criteria for potential designation for sanctions. They added: “It would be ludicrous to suggest that our client has any responsibility or influence over the behaviour of the Russian state.” Evraz has previously held multiple assets in Ukraine but disposed of them in 2018. Referring to the war in its financial results, the company said: “While there have not been direct impacts on the group to date, the board continues to monitor the situation in Ukraine and the response of international governments.” The Guardian has approached Evraz for further comment. Shares in Evraz were up almost 20% on Friday afternoon, making it the top riser on the FTSE 100.",0
42,"Friday, 25 February 2022",2022-02-25,RT news channel in spotlight in UK over pro-Russia slant on Ukraine crisis,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/feb/25/rt-news-channel-uk-pro-russia-slant-ukraine-crisis,,"As Russian troops pushed into Ukraine on Thursday, viewers of the RT news channel learned a new vocabulary. Rather than an invasion, the Russian actions were described on air as a “special military operation”. Instead of seizing territory from another nation, viewers were told that troops were trying to “liberate” land from Ukraine on behalf of two Russian-backed breakaway states.  And if there was any doubt about the justification used by Vladimir Putin for his war, then RT’s British presenter Rory Suchet – the son of the former ITN journalist John Suchet – explained to viewers that the objective was “to defend the Donbas” in the face of Ukrainian aggression. The Kremlin-funded rolling news channel, which has long delighted in its own outsider status, has again come under intense scrutiny in the UK for its willingness to follow the narrative of the Russian government. The Labour leader, Sir Keir Starmer, demanded RT’s broadcast licence be revoked, telling the House of Commons the organisation once known as Russia Today was Putin’s “personal propaganda tool”. He added: “I can see no reason why it should be allowed to continue to broadcast in this country.” However, this has also raised concerns about opening up a tit-for-tat media expulsion battle with Russia, which last year kicked out the BBC’s Russia correspondent Sarah Rainsford. “There is too much focus on the television channel – its impact is minimal,” said Prof Stephen Hutchings of the University of Manchester, who is writing a book on Russian media that focuses on RT. “The television channel almost has symbolic value. They can’t claim to be an international broadcaster on a par with CNN and BBC without a television channel. But really their most impactful output is online and on social media and YouTube.” The media regulator, Ofcom, which in extreme circumstances can revoke the licences of television channels, is actively monitoring RT’s output for potential breaches of the broadcasting code. But there is no ban on partisan current affairs broadcasting in the UK, as long as viewers are also exposed to some alternative viewpoints – the same rule that allows a channel such as GB News to broadcast with a rightwing slant. Kevin Bakhurst, Ofcom’s content boss, told the Guardian he did not have any “substantial evidence” that RT was being directly controlled by a foreign state, which could force it to give up its licence. He insisted it was perfectly legal for British television channels to have the worldview of the country that they were funded by: “You’d expect that. However, they need to respect the broadcasting code.” It was RT’s failure to meet these standards in its coverage of the Salisbury poisonings that led to it being fined £200,000 by Ofcom in 2019 – but deciding where to draw the line is an art rather than a science. The regulator also takes into account viewer expectations of a channel when considering how to enforce its rules – essentially making the assumption that if you are watching RT then you are expecting to see a strong pro-Russian viewpoint reflected in its coverage. There are also bigger forces at play. The expectation is that if RT is taken off air in the UK, then the BBC’s Russian services will be quickly binned by the Kremlin – the same fate that befell the German public broadcaster Deutsche Welle when the German media regulator took RT off air earlier this month. In any eventuality, there would be nothing to stop RT continuing to produce online content for a British audience, free from regulation, while claiming to have been silenced. Bakhurst said the British media regulator would take this into account when considering any enforcement activity: “We’d be mad not to think of the wider implications, not just for BBC journalists based in Russia but for Ukraine.” This has led to BBC sources raising concerns that removing RT’s broadcast licence would be unhelpful, given how few viewers RT has in the UK. The channel took the unusual decision to pull out of the Barb audience rating system in late 2019. However, RT’s final viewing figures suggested it was reaching only about 79,000 Britons a day and that the average viewer watched for less than a minute – giving it an audience comparable with an obscure satellite film channel. It has increasingly become a pariah outlet that struggles to book mainstream politicians and guests. The former Scottish first minister Alex Salmond, who has hosted a show on RT since 2017, this week said he would stop making the programme “until peace is re-established”. Hutchings said his research found RT often carried more diverse viewpoints than its critics acknowledged – but that this changed at moments of crisis. “When Russia’s interests are perceived to be at stake everyone comes behind the central approved narrative. A small group of elite media executives meet with the Kremlin on a weekly basis and they agree the broad agenda and then that’s fed down to the head of news who will translate that into a set of narratives.” He said that while the “Kremlin is determining the narrative” of RT, if Ofcom suspended the channel’s British broadcast licence due to political pressure then it could be counterproductive. “It’s playing the Russian game. We are a society that claims to follow due process.”",0

As Russian forces menace the Ukrainian capital and thousands flee, the very least onlookers around the world can do is learn how to say the name of the city under siege.  The short answer is simple: Ukrainians call their capital “Kyiv” (kee-yiv), the spelling, a transliteration of the Ukrainian Київ. The Russian version is “Kiev” (kee-yev). The latter, based on transliteration from the Russian cyrillic Киев, became the internationally accepted name through the Soviet period and into the first years of this century, its recognisability enhanced perhaps by the eponymous chicken dish that became popular in the west in the 1970s. But it is now associated with the Russification of Ukraine, and in recent years more and more publications, governments, airports and geographical dictionaries have switched the spelling to the Ukrainian variant. “When I meet someone new, I like to pronounce their name the way they want it pronounced in their language, which is why I think it’s right to pronounce it ‘Kyiv’ as close to the Ukrainian as possible,” said Andrii Smytsniuk, Ukrainian language teacher at Cambridge University. “Many Ukrainians see this as a sign of respect for their language and identity.” 01:12Explosions and gunfire across Kyiv during Russian night assault – video The reason for the difference between the two is bound up in centuries of linguistic evolution in a region that has fallen under Mongol, Lithuanian, Polish and Russian empires over the past 1,000 years. Russian and Ukrainian are both east Slavonic languages (as opposed to west Slavonic languages such as Polish, and south Slavonic ones like Bulgarian). “They all come from an original root, but diverged in the ways that languages do,” says Monica White, associate professor in Russian and Slavonic studies at Nottingham University. Ukrainian took on some Polish influences during the early modern period. Several Ukrainian vowels ended up being pronounced quite differently from their Russian counterparts – not an unusual thing in languages when you think about how the word “time” is pronounced in Melbourne, Middlesbrough and Mississippi. There are several letters of the alphabet unique to Ukrainian, for example the ї in Київ, and enough differences in vocabulary to make it hard for Russophones to understand Ukrainians when they speak in their tongue. Not surprisingly, the Ukrainian government mounted a campaign four years ago to secure international approval for the name of its capital city. There is even a popular Twitter hashtag, #KyivNotKiev.",0

Russia has mounted a major assault on a neighbour in pursuit of Vladimir Putin’s claims on the territories of the former Russian empire. But if Russia were to fail badly at this, and suffer an unambiguous setback, that would be exactly the shock the country needed to start the long, hard process of transitioning from a frustrated former imperial power to a normal country that can coexist with Europe.  In contrast to other European imperial powers, for Russia the end of empire was postponed. It came not at the end of the first world war, or of the second, but at the end of the cold war. Russia is not the only former colonial power to have complex relations with its former dominions in the wake of imperial retreat. However, even given its late start, it has not travelled as far along the path of post-imperial normalisation as countries such as the United Kingdom, France or Portugal had a quarter-century after the end of empire. Today, Russia sees its relations with its former dominions in the way that France or Britain did in the first few years after their power was curtailed – before they suffered the defeats and setbacks that drove home the new limits of their ability to shape the world beyond their own borders. At the same point in this post-imperial trajectory, Britain had waged a successful campaign against communism in Malaya, but had not yet suffered the humiliating setback of Suez. Russia has achieved success in small wars in Chechnya and Georgia, and projected power more recently in Syria, Kazakhstan and across Africa. Successful military adventurism both close to home and farther afield prolongs Russia’s belief in its power and its right to dominate others. But the first military defeat would have far-reaching consequences. With its control of the information space at home, Russia can spin or explain away political reverses abroad, but not an unarguable military setback that calls into doubt either Russian military power itself or the ability to exercise it unchallenged. It is only this that can constrain Russia’s future ambition to reassert itself as the dominant power across the countries of eastern Europe, which it sees as its birthright. And it is only significant failure that will lead Russia’s leadership eventually to start to reassess its place in the world. Ukraine is unlikely to be able to halt Russia on its own, so it is the duty of the west to help Russia by ensuring its defeat. So far, it has shirked that duty. Even after the US and UK ruled out direct defensive support to Ukraine, it would have been possible to put in place no-fly zones or maritime exclusion zones, or even to deliver a genuine peacekeeping force to Ukraine to match Russia’s promise to send in its own fake “peacekeepers” in the east of the country. But now the invasion has begun, any of these measures would constitute major escalation by western powers. Instead of simply arriving in Ukrainian airspace to protect it, western air forces would have to fight their way in. Having failed to deter Russia in advance, western efforts now seem focused on finding ways to punish it after the fact. But in addition, the US and its European allies must urgently step up efforts to help Ukraine defend itself, providing weapons, supplies and intelligence to assist in stalling the Russian invaders. Providing indirect support to Ukraine in cyberspace and maintaining pressure on Russian interests and operations away from Europe will also help to put pressure on Moscow. For now, Russia’s behaviour is driven by the fact that it is the only country among the 15 former Soviet republics that is unhappy about the fall of the Soviet Union. The other countries took the events of 1991 as a new opportunity – as a chance to regain independence that was lost decades before. Russia is different. It’s the only country with a leader who openly describes the events of 30 years ago as a catastrophe. Many of Russia’s actions against its neighbours stem from an inability to adjust to the idea that Moscow no longer rules over lands beyond its borders. They also stem from Russia’s distinctive ideas about its own status as a “great power” – in a sense that we associate with the 19th century – and of how exactly the cold war came to an end. President Putin has convinced himself that Russia was a joint “winner” of the cold war, and was entitled to share the rewards of victory with the west. President Putin and his foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, have pointed to precedents for constructive Russian involvement in European politics that led to periods of extended peace and stability. The problem is that the precedents they choose, the Congress of Vienna in 1815 and the Yalta conference agreements in 1945, are examples of victorious powers in a world war agreeing among themselves how to run the world over the heads of smaller or defeated states. With or without Russia, this template just doesn’t fit with European notions of relations between states in the 21st century. And it completely misses the point that Russia did not emerge victorious from the cold war. This leads directly to another factor augmenting the danger of current Russian behaviour: overconfidence by Putin and his entourage. Putin has had such a long series of wins that he may have started to believe his own propaganda – that Russia can push forward unopposed, and that the weak, decadent west is in rapid and inevitable decline. It may also have led Russia to underestimate the potential for Ukrainian resistance during the invasion and in the event of possible occupation. But it is precisely the way Russia continues to get it wrong that puts at risk the fragile freedoms that Russia’s other former imperial possessions regained just 30 years ago. Because if Putin is to be believed – and so far he has acted on his convictions – Russia will not stop its drive to reconquer its former possessions at Ukraine. What stops Russia, and has done reliably over centuries, is credible military force being present and ready in advance. Dialogue and diplomacy, the first resorts of western statecraft, have been shown to have no impact on a country that is operating on a different plane of reality and in a different century. Russia’s confidence to act against Ukraine stems from the failure of deterrence by the west overall. It is vital that the west relearns what it takes to put up a stop sign for Moscow.
